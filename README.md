# SwipeStats

> Visualize your dating data

A modern dating app analytics platform that helps you understand your Tinder and Hinge performance through beautiful insights and data visualizations.

## How to Use

1. **Get your data** from Tinder at [account.gotinder.com/data](https://account.gotinder.com/data) or Hinge
2. **Upload your data** at [swipestats.io](https://swipestats.io)
3. **View insights** - Analyze your matches, messages, swipe patterns, and compare yourself to cohorts
4. **Track your journey** - Add life events and see how they impact your dating app performance

## Privacy

SwipeStats takes your privacy seriously. Your data is anonymized using a unique ID generated by hashing your email and account creation date with the SHA256 algorithm. This means your email and personal information never reach the server in their original form.

```typescript
export async function createSHA256Hash(str: string) {
  const utf8 = new TextEncoder().encode(str);
  const hashBuffer = await crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-256", utf8);
  const hashArray = Array.from(new Uint8Array(hashBuffer));
  const hashHex = hashArray
    .map((bytes) => bytes.toString(16).padStart(2, "0"))
    .join("");
  return hashHex;
}
```

Your profile ID is created deterministically, so if you upload your file again in the future, your data will be updated without creating duplicates:

```typescript
const profileId = await createSHA256Hash(
  birthDate + "-" + appProfileCreateDate,
);
```
