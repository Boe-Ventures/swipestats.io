## How Elite Singles Works

Elite Singles positions itself as the go-to dating app for educated, career-oriented individuals looking for meaningful and genuineniune connections.

Unlike the endless swiping on [Tinder](https://www.swipestats.io/blog/tinder-review) or the women-message-first approach of [Bumble](https://www.swipestats.io/blog/bumble-review), Elite Singles employs a comprehensive personality test to match users based on compatibility.

### How is Elite Singles different from other dating apps?

The app's main differentiator is its focus on personality-based matching. While apps like [Hinge](https://www.swipestats.io/blog/hinge-review) have introduced some elements of compatibility matching, Elite Singles goes all-in with a 200-question personality assessment based on the Five-Factor Model of personality.

### User base overview

Elite Singles claims to cater to a highly educated crowd, with 85% of users holding an above-average education. The platform targets professionals aged 30-50, aiming to connect individuals with similar life goals and values.

However, the actual user experience often differs from these lofty claims, as we'll explore later.

## Pros & Cons of Elite Singles

### Pros:

- In-depth personality assessment: The detailed questionnaire can lead to more compatible matches.
- Educated user base: A higher chance of connecting with career-driven individuals.
- Focus on serious and committed relationships: Ideal for those tired of casual dating scenes.

- You're a busy professional seeking a serious, long-term relationship
- You're willing to invest time in a detailed personality assessment
- You value education and career ambition in a partner
- You're tired of casual dating apps and want more refined matches

## Key Features of Elite Singles

### Personality Assessment

The cornerstone of Elite Singles is its extensive personality test. Based on the Five Factor Model, this 200-question assessment delves into your character traits, values, and relationship goals.

While time-consuming (expect to spend about 45 minutes), it's crucial for generating supposedly high-quality matches.

### Intelligent Matchmaking

Using your personality assessment results, Elite Singles' algorithm suggests 3-7 compatible matches daily. In theory, this saves time by presenting you with potential partners who align with your preferences and values.

However, user experiences vary widely, with some reporting great matches and others complaining about irrelevant suggestions.

### Have You Met?

This feature is Elite Singles' nod to the popularity of swiping apps. It presents you with additional profiles that may be slightly outside your usual preferences, allowing for more spontaneous connections. It's a way to expand your dating pool beyond the algorithm's strict parameters.

### Wildcard Matches

For those feeling adventurous, Elite Singles offers wild card matches. These are profiles that may not perfectly align with your stated preferences but could still be intriguing.

It's meant to encourage users to keep an open mind, though some users report that these matches often feel random rather than intriguing.

### Privacy and Security

Elite Singles claims to take user safety seriously, with manual profile verification and SSL encryption. However, the high number of user complaints about fake profiles suggests that these measures may not be as effective as advertised.

## Sign-Up Process & Creating a Profile

1. Visit the Elite Singles website or download the app.
2. Provide basic information like gender, partner preference, and email.
3. Complete the extensive personality questionnaire (plan for about 45 minutes).
4. Upload photos and write a brief bio.
5. Set your perfect match preferences, including age range and location.
6. Verify your email address to activate your account.
   While the sign-up process is straightforward, the lengthy personality test can be a significant time investment. Some users appreciate the depth, while others find it tedious.

## Elite Singles Costs

Elite Singles operates on a freemium model, with limited features available to free users. For full access, you'll need a premium membership:

- 12-month membership: $31.95 per month ($383.40 total)
- 6-month membership: $44.95 per month ($269.70 total)
- 3-month membership: $57.95 per month ($173.85 total)
  With a premium plan, you can enjoy more in-depth features, like unlimited messaging, extra matches per day, and more.

These prices are significantly higher than many competing dating apps. While Elite Singles argues that the cost reflects the quality of their service, many users feel the value doesn't justify the price, especially given the complaints about fake profiles and matching quality.

## How Swipestats Rates Elite Singles

Overall verdict: 3.5/5 - Elite Singles offers a potentially sophisticated dating experience for professionals, but user complaints and high costs are significant drawbacks.

### Attractiveness of the matches: 3.5/5

While Elite Singles promises high-quality matches, user experiences vary widely. Some report connecting with attractive, successful professionals, while others complain about a lack of active users or matches that don't meet their preferences.

### User base: 3/5

Elite Singles claims a user base of educated professionals, but it's smaller than mainstream apps. This can mean fewer matches, especially in less populated areas. Additionally, concerns about fake profiles and inactive accounts detract from the quality of the user base.

### Match rate: 3.5/5

The successful match rate on Elite Singles tends to be lower than on swipe-based apps, but with potentially higher quality. When matches do occur, there's a greater chance of compatibility due to the detailed personality matching. However, many users report receiving matches that don't align with their preferences.

### Pricing: 2.5/5

There's no way around it – Elite Singles is expensive. While the premium features might justify the cost for some users, many feel the price is too high, especially given the issues with fake profiles and matching accuracy. The difficulty in canceling subscriptions further detracts from the value proposition.

## The Scam Controversy: Separating Fact from Fiction

Numerous online reviews and complaints label Elite Singles as an absolute scam. While it's important to approach these claims critically, the volume and consistency of complaints are concerning. Here's a breakdown of the main issues:

### Fake Profiles

Many users report encountering profiles that seem too good to be true, with model-like photos and generic responses. While Elite Singles claims to verify profiles manually, the prevalence of these complaints suggests that their system may not be as robust as advertised.

### Billing Issues

A significant number of users have reported problems with billing, including:

- Difficulty canceling subscriptions
- Unexpected charges after cancellation
- Charges appearing under different company names on bank statements
  These issues have led some users to feel deceived by the platform's billing practices.

### Poor Match Quality

Despite the promise of sophisticated matching based on personality analysis, many users report receiving matches that don't align with their stated preferences.

This includes matches outside specified age ranges or locations, as well as inactive profiles. Some users speculate that the platform might prioritize keeping paying members engaged over providing truly compatible matches.

### Customer Service Complaints

Numerous reviews mention difficulties in contacting customer service, especially regarding subscription cancellations or billing issues. Some users report long wait times, unhelpful responses, or being directed to hard-to-find cancellation pages.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Elite Singles

### Is Elite Singles really for elite singles?

Despite the name, Elite Singles isn't exclusively for the wealthy or famous. The "elite" refers more to educational background and career ambition. However, user experiences suggest that the actual membership base may be more diverse than advertised.

### How can I cancel my Elite Singles subscription?

To cancel, log into your account, go to "My Account" settings, and select "Membership." From there, you can manage your subscription and cancel auto-renewal. Given the reported difficulties with cancellation, it's advisable to do this well before your renewal date and follow up with customer service if needed.

### Can I get a refund if I'm unsatisfied with Elite Singles?

Elite Singles' refund policy is strict. They generally don't offer refunds unless required by local consumer protection laws. Always read the terms of service carefully before subscribing.

### How does Elite Singles compare to other online dating sites like eHarmony?

Both Elite Singles and eHarmony focus on detailed personality matching for serious relationships. However, eHarmony generally has a larger user base and fewer complaints about fake profiles. On the other hand, Elite Singles may offer a more tailored experience for career-oriented professionals.

### Are there any alternatives for professional dating?

Yes, several alternatives cater to a similar audience:

1. [The League](https://www.swipestats.io/blog/best-dating-apps): An exclusive app that vets members based on LinkedIn and Facebook profiles.
2. Coffee Meets Bagel: Focuses on quality matches for young professionals.
3. [Bumble](https://www.swipestats.io/blog/bumble-review): While not exclusively for professionals, its women-message-first approach attracts career-oriented individuals.

## The Bottom Line: Is Elite Singles Worth It?

Elite Singles presents itself as a premium option for professionals seeking serious relationships. Its detailed personality profile matching and focus on educated singles could make it a valuable platform. However, the high subscription costs, numerous user complaints, and concerns about fake profiles make it a risky investment.
