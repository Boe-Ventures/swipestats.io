<TLDR>

## TL;DR: Best Answers That Actually Work

Let's cut through the bullshit. I'm Paw Markus, and after years of helping thousands of guys navigate the clusterfuck that is modern dating, I've figured out what actually works on Hinge.

No pickup artist garbage, no manipulation tactics – just real, tested answers that show who you are without trying too hard.

- **My favorite answer:** "...sends random dolphin facts at 2 AM"
- **Best cheeky answer:** "...owns at least three plants that aren't dead yet"
- **Best funny answer:** "...owns more than one towel"
- **Best deeply personal answer:** "...emotional intelligence, the courage to be vulnerable, and someone who values personal growth"
  PS: they also work on Bumble

PPS: they don't work on your CV

## How NOT to Answer This Prompt (Unless You Want to Die Alone)

Look, I've seen enough terrible Hinge profiles to fill several books of "What Not To Do If You Ever Want to Get Laid Again."

Through our [dating app data analysis](https://swipestats.io/), we've found that these answers are about as attractive as discussing your ex on a first date. Here's what to avoid if you don't want to come across as a walking red flag yourself:

- ..."no drama" (Spoiler alert: You're the drama)
- ..."must be hot" (Congratulations, you've just announced you're shallow AF)
- ..."has a job and their own place" (Wow, such high standards. What's next, "must breathe oxygen"?)
- ..."doesn't play games" (The irony of this being the biggest game-player response possible)
- ..."good vibes only" (Translation: "I'm emotionally unavailable and can't handle real conversations")

## How I Would Actually Answer This Without Being a Try-Hard

Here's the thing – the best answers to this prompt aren't trying to impress anyone. They're honest, slightly amusing, and give potential matches something to actually respond to. After helping countless guys improve their [dating app success](https://swipestats.io/swipeguide), here are some answers that work because they're real:

- ..."gets irrationally excited about their favorite foods (if you don't have strong opinions about pizza toppings, what DO you care about?)"
- ..."sends random dolphin facts at 2 AM because they can't keep cool information to themselves"
- ..."knows that liking The Office isn't a personality trait but quotes it anyway"
- ..."understands that sometimes the best dates are just ordering takeout and watching bad movies"
- ..."can admit when they're wrong (bonus points if they can laugh about it)"
- ..."has specific playlists for oddly specific moods like 'it's raining and I'm feeling nostalgic about 2007'"
- ..."remembers random conversation details because they actually give a shit"
- ..."defends their controversial food opinions with passion (if you think pineapple belongs on pizza, at least own it)"
- ..."can handle comfortable silences without reaching for their phone"
- ..."gets genuinely excited about small things, like finding money in old jeans or perfect avocado ripeness"

## Cheeky Answers That Actually Get Responses

Let's be real – being a smartass can work if you do it right. And by "right," I mean not being a total douchebag about it. These answers walk that fine line between witty and "trying too hard to be funny guy at the party":

- ..."owns at least three plants that aren't dead yet"
- ..."doesn't think crypto is a personality trait"
- ..."can parallel park without having an existential crisis"
- ..."has never used the phrase 'that's just how I am' as an excuse"
- ..."doesn't think tacos and margs make them unique"
- ..."owns actual furniture that didn't come from IKEA (bonus points if they kept all the IKEA pieces together)"
- ..."doesn't have a podcast about their gym routine"
- ..."understands that hiking isn't a substitute for having a personality"
- ..."can cook something other than pasta and eggs"
- ..."hasn't posted a gym mirror selfie in at least 3 months"

## Funny Answers That Don't Try Too Hard

Here's the thing about humor on dating apps – if you have to force it, it's probably not funny. These answers work because they're relatable and don't scream "I googled funny hinge answers." Want to see what works for others?
