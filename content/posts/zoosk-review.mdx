## How Zoosk Works

Zoosk is a dating app that sets itself apart by employing a "Behavioral Matchmaking" system. It's like having a digital wingman that learns your type as you swipe, message, and interact with other active users. The more you use the app, the smarter it gets at finding potential matches tailored to your preferences.

### How is Zoosk different from other dating apps?

While apps like [Tinder](/blog/tinder-review) and [Bumble](/blog/bumble-review) rely heavily on swiping and mutual matches, Zoosk takes a more holistic approach. It analyzes your behavior on the app to understand your dating preferences better. This means you're not just limited to who you swipe on – the app actively learns and adapts to your tastes over time.

### Zoosk's user base: A melting pot of singles

With over 40 million members worldwide, you'll find people of all ages, backgrounds, and relationship goals. Whether you're looking for a casual fling or a long-term commitment, there's likely someone on Zoosk who's on the same page. Nothing helps you stand out in a sea of people like quality photos that show your best side.

## Key Features of Zoosk

### Behavioral Matchmaking

This is Zoosk's bread and butter. The algorithm analyzes your likes, dislikes, and interactions to suggest better matches over time. It's like having a personal dating assistant that gets smarter the more you use the app.

While not perfect, it can lead to some surprisingly accurate suggestions.

### SmartPick

Think of SmartPick as Zoosk's crème de la crème of matches. These are profiles the app believes are highly compatible with you based on your behavior and preferences. It's a nice feature for those days when you don't feel like sifting through endless profiles.

### Carousel

Swipe right, swipe left, or click "Maybe" – the Carousel feature is Zoosk's take on the popular swiping mechanic. It's a quick and fun way to browse potential matches, and it helps the app learn more about your type. Plus, if you both say "Yes," it's an instant match!

### Super Send

This feature lets you send a message to lots of users at once. While it might seem like a time-saver, use it wisely – personalized messages tend to get better responses. It's unique to Zoosk but can come across as spammy if not used thoughtfully.

### Zoosk Live

Zoosk Live is the platform's newest livestreaming feature, bringing a fresh and interactive dimension to online dating. This live-streaming feature allows users to broadcast themselves, watch other streams, and interact in real-time with potential matches.

### Zoosk Coins

Zoosk's virtual currency can be used to boost your profile visibility or send virtual gifts. It's an interesting concept, but be careful not to get carried away – those coin packages can add up quickly!

## Sign-Up Process & Creating a Profile

1. Download the app or visit the Zoosk dating service site.
2. Choose to sign up with your email, Facebook, or Google account.
3. Fill in basic information like your gender, the gender you're interested in, and your birthday.
4. Upload at least one photo (more is better).
5. Answer some basic questions about your appearance, lifestyle, and what you're looking for.
6. Verify your account through phone or social media (optional but recommended).
7. Start exploring matches and features!

If you're serious about finding a match and enjoy the data-driven approach, it might be worth splurging on a premium membership subscription for the best value.

## How Swipestats Rates Zoosk

Overall verdict: 3.5/5 - Zoosk offers a unique approach to online dating with its Behavioral Matchmaking, but it comes at a price. It's a solid option for those willing to invest in their dating life, but it may not be the best choice for everyone.

### Attractiveness of the matches: 3.5/5

The quality of matches on Zoosk is generally good, with a diverse range of attractive people. However, it's not quite on par with more selective apps like [Hinge](/blog/hinge-review). You'll find plenty of eye-catching profiles, but be prepared to do some filtering.

### User base: 4/5

With over 40 million members worldwide, Zoosk boasts an impressive and diverse user base. You're likely to find people of various ages, backgrounds, and relationship goals. However, the activity level of users can vary, and you may encounter some inactive profiles.

### Match rate: 3.5/5

The match rate on Zoosk is decent, thanks in part to the Behavioral Matchmaking system. As the behavioral technology learns your preferences, you may notice an improvement in the quality and frequency of your matches.

However, it's not as instantaneous as some swipe-based apps, and you'll need to put in some effort to see the best results.

### Pricing: 3/5

Let's be honest – Zoosk isn't cheap. While the features justify the cost to some extent, it's on the pricier side compared to many other online dating sites. The value improves with longer subscriptions, but it's still a significant investment. Make sure you're committed to using the app regularly to get your money's worth.
