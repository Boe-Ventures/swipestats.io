</TLDR>

## What is Doublelist: The Digital Playground for Adults

Doublelist isn't your grandma's dating site – unless your grandma's into some seriously kinky shit.

This platform is the lovechild of Craigslist personals and a hookup site that's been hitting the gym.

It's where the digitally savvy go when they're looking for something between a one-night stand and a "let's see where this goes" situation.

### How is Doublelist different from other dating apps?

Doublelist throws the swipe-right-and-hope-for-the-best playbook out the window and brings back the classified ad format with a vengeance.

It's less about curated selfies and witty one-liners, and more about raw, unfiltered desires.

You want categories? Oh boy, does Doublelist have categories. From the vanilla "men seeking women" to stuff that would make even the most open-minded folks raise an eyebrow.

It's like walking through Amsterdam's Red Light District, but from the comfort of your couch.

### The Doublelist crowd: A melting pot of desires

Picture this: You're at the most eclectic bar in town at 2 AM on a Saturday. Now, digitize that crowd, amp up their horniness by about 200%, and you've got the Doublelist user base.

You've got your standard singles looking for a good time, couples trying to spice up their love life, and folks exploring every nook and cranny of the sexual spectrum.

It's diverse, it's open-minded, and it's definitely not for the faint of heart. If you're easily shocked or clutch your pearls at the mention of anything beyond missionary, you might want to stick to [Hinge](/blog/hinge-review).

## Pros & Cons of Doublelist: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

### Pros:

1. **Diverse user base:** Whatever you're into, there's probably someone else into it too. It's like a sexual United Nations up in here.
2. **Straightforward approach:** No beating around the bush. Users are upfront about what they want, saving you time and awkward conversations.
3. **Niche categories:** From furries to foot fetishists, there's a category for that.
4. **Free to use:** Because who doesn't love free stuff? Your wallet will thank you, even if your common sense might not.
5. **Anonymity:** For those who prefer to keep their freak flag flying under the radar.

### Cons:

1. **Lack of proper verification:** It's easier to find Bigfoot than to verify if someone is who they say they are.
2. **Higher risk of scams:** If you think Nigerian princes are bad, wait till you meet the scammers on Doublelist.
3. **Not for serious relationships:** Looking for love? You're more likely to find Waldo.
4. **Overwhelming explicitness:** If you blush easily, you might end up looking like a tomato.
5. **Safety concerns:** Meeting strangers from the internet is always a risk, but on Doublelist, it's like playing Russian roulette with your personal safety.

## Who Is Doublelist For? The Brave and the Bold

### Doublelist is for you if:

- You're open to casual encounters and no-strings-attached fun
- You have specific kinks or interests that mainstream apps don't cater to
- You value anonymity in your online escapades
- You're comfortable navigating a less regulated online environment
- You enjoy the thrill of the unknown (and potentially questionable)
- You're experienced in online dating and can spot red flags from a mile away

### It's not for you if:

- You're looking for a soulmate or long-term relationship (though never say never I guess)
- You prefer a more controlled, verified user base
- You're easily overwhelmed by explicit content
- You're not comfortable with potential safety risks
- You're new to online dating and still figuring things out
- You have a hard time saying no or setting boundaries

## Key Features of Doublelist: The Good, the Bad, and the Downright Weird

### Classified-style listings: A blast from the past

Remember the good old days of Craigslist personals? Doublelist brings that back with a vengeance. It's like a sexual marketplace where you can window shop for potential hookups.

The upside? It's straightforward.

The downside? You never quite know what you're gonna get in the end.

### Diverse categories: Choose your own adventure

From vanilla to kinky, Doublelist offers a smorgasbord of categories. Whether you're into traditional hookups or something that requires a safe word, there's probably a listing for that. It's like a Baskin Robbins of sexual preferences – 31 flavors and then some.

### Anonymity: Your secret's safe (kind of)

Unlike many hookup apps, Doublelist doesn't require you to link social media or verify your identity. It's great for privacy, not so great for safety. You can be whoever you want to be – which means so can everyone else. It's a double-edged sword sharper than your ex's tongue.

### Local focus: Keeping it in the neighborhood

The platform emphasizes local connections, making it easier to find hookups in your area. Just remember, "local" doesn't always mean "legit." That hot single in your area might just be a bot from Russia.

### Simple interface: No bells, no whistles

Doublelist keeps it simple. No fancy algorithms, no swiping mechanics, just good old-fashioned browsing. It's refreshingly straightforward, but it might feel a bit dated if you're used to sleeker apps.

### Direct messaging: Cut to the chase

Once you find an ad that tickles your fancy, you can message the poster directly. No need for mutual matches or clever pickup lines. It's efficient, but it also means your inbox might become a war zone of unsolicited messages.

## The Doublelist Experience: A Walk on the Wild Side

### Browsing and searching: A treasure hunt (or a horror show)

Navigating Doublelist is like being a kid in a candy store – if that candy store was in the sketchy part of town and half the candy was potentially poisonous. The search function is basic but functional. You can filter by category, gender, and location. But be warned: what you find might alternately titillate or terrify you.

### Creating a listing: Putting yourself out there (literally)

Want to create your own ad? It's as easy as writing a slightly NSFW version of a "For Sale" notice. Be specific about what you want, but maybe leave out your social security number and blood type. The platform gives you freedom of expression, which is both liberating and potentially incriminating.

### Responding to ads: Shooting your shot in the dark

See an ad you like? Responding is as simple as sending an email. But here's where it gets tricky – you're often shooting your shot based on very little information. It's like trying to hit a dartboard while blindfolded and slightly drunk.

### The chat function: Where the magic (or mayhem) happens

Once you've made a connection, you can chat directly through the platform. It's basic, it's functional, and it's where you'll either set up the hookup of your dreams or realize you've been chatting with a bot selling discount Viagra.

## Sign-Up Process & Creating a Profile: Quick and Dirty

1. Visit the Doublelist website or download the app.
2. Choose your location – keeping it local is the name of the game.
3. Agree to the terms of service (spoiler alert: nobody reads these).
4. Verify you're over 18 (it's on the honor system, folks).
5. Create a username and password. Pro tip: Maybe don't use "HotStud69" or "SexyMama420".
6. Optional: Add an email for account recovery. Use a burner email if you're paranoid (or smart).
7. Start browsing or post your own ad. The world is your oyster – a potentially disease-ridden oyster, but an oyster nonetheless.

## Doublelist Costs: Free as a Bird (But at What Cost?)

Here's the kicker – Doublelist is completely free. No premium tiers, no hidden fees, no suddenly discovering you need to pay to read that message from HottieMcHotPants. But remember, if you're not paying for the product, you are the product. The lack of a paywall means it's easier for scammers and fake profiles to infiltrate the platform.

Is free always better? In the case of Doublelist, it's a double-edged sword. On one hand, you can explore without dropping a dime. On the other hand, the lack of financial investment means people might be less serious or reliable. It's like getting free tickets to a concert, but the band might not show up.

## How Swipestats Rates Doublelist: The Nitty-Gritty

Overall verdict: 3/5 - A wild ride with potential for both pleasure and peril.

### Attractiveness of the users: 3/5

It's a mixed bag, folks. You'll find everything from model material to "maybe after a few drinks." The anonymity factor means people are often more focused on describing what they want than showcasing their looks. It's like a box of chocolates – you never know what you're gonna get, and some of them might be past their expiration date.

### User base: 3/5

Doublelist boasts a diverse and active user base. Whatever you're into, you're likely to find someone who's into it too. It's like a sexual United Nations – all types are represented. Just be prepared to wade through some questionable profiles and maybe learn some new terms to Google (incognito mode recommended).

### Match rate: 3.5/5

It's fairly easy to match compared to many other apps. If you're not picky and you cast a wide net, you'll probably get some bites. But quality matches? That's where things get tricky.

Like with any other app, it's a numbers game, and you'll need to sift through a lot of sand to find any gold. Think of it like panning for gold in a river that's also used as a sewage dump – there might be treasure, but you'll have to deal with a lot of crap.

### Pricing: 5/5

It's free. Can't beat that. But remember, you get what you pay for – or in this case, what you don't pay for. The lack of monetary investment means you might encounter more time-wasters, scammers, and people who aren't serious about meeting up.

## Safety and Security: Proceed with Caution

Let's get real for a moment. Doublelist is about as safe as skateboarding down a mountain while blindfolded. The platform's hands-off approach to verification means you're largely on your own when it comes to staying safe. Here are some tips to keep your adventures more "exciting" and less "evening news headline":

1. **Trust your gut:** If something feels off, it probably is. Your instincts evolved over millions of years – use them.
2. **Meet in public:** Always, always, always meet new contacts in a public place first. No exceptions, no matter how charming they seem.
3. **Tell a friend:** Let someone know where you're going and who you're meeting. It's not paranoid, it's smart.
4. **Use protection:** Both digital (don't share personal info) and physical (wrap it up, folks).
5. **Don't send money:** If they're asking for cash, they're probably not interested in your sparkling personality.
   Remember, in the world of Doublelist, you're not just protecting your heart – you're protecting your identity, your wallet, and potentially your physical safety.
