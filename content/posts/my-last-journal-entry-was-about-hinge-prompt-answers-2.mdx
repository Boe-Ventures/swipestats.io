So, you're getting matches and staring at their profile like it's a calculus problem. You're trying to figure out what the hell to say that won't make you sound like every other dude in her DMs.

I get it. You want to be clever but not try-hard. Interesting but not weird. Confident but not douchey. It's exhausting.

Don't craft these annoyingly elaborate, "unique" messages that come off desperate. And don't go the opposite direction and send a boring old "hey" either.

Both approaches suck.

We've looked at hundreds of conversations across different profiles. We studied what Hinge's own research says, and tested openers that actually get responses. Especially responses that lead somewhere.

Let's cut through the bullshit.

**TL;DR:**

- The best Hinge openers are playful, easy to respond to, and feel personalized rather than generic

- Games and "this or that" questions consistently outperform simple greetings or compliments

- Commenting on prompts instead of photos leads to higher response rates

- Your opener should establish a fun, flirty tone while making her want to prove herself to you

## Why Most Hinge Openers Fail (And What Actually Works)

"Hey" doesn't fail because it's rude. It fails because it's boring.

Think about it from her perspective. She has 15 matches. Maybe 20. Each one could potentially be interesting. She's going to respond to the guy who seems fun, who makes her curious, who sparks something. Psst... these [AI dating photos](https://getdates.ai) help your profile standout as much as your personality!

Complicating things with elaborate and eager texts can seem desperate.

Most guys mess up and swing too far in the other direction. They write paragraphs analyzing her photos, ask deep philosophical questions, and try so hard to stand out. It looks weird.

Good openers need only two things:

First, they need to demand a response. Not aggressively, but by intriguing you. Questions, games, and playful assumptions work. Make her think "ooh, I want to respond to this" instead of "ugh, what do I even say to that?"

Second, to set the tone. Not friendly. Not polite. Playful. Flirty without being too forward. Fun without being clownish.

The first message sets the tone of your entire interaction. Don't start like you're applying for a job. You should both be seeing if the other person is "worthy of your time." Stand on equal grounds.

Don't be an asshole... or a pushover. The best openers subtly communicate that you're interesting and she should prove herself a little too. Not overtly. Not like a pickup artist. Just... naturally.
