## **The Final Scene**

Alright, cinephiles and movie quote aficionados, you've now got enough material to make your Hinge profile look like the script of a Tarantino flick (minus the gratuitous violence, hopefully).

Remember, a great movie quote can be a conversation starter, but it's your personality that'll keep the credits from rolling on your potential romance. If you're still struggling to get matches, it might be time for a [**profile review**](/products/dating-profile-review). Sometimes, we all need a little direction to become the star of our own romantic comedy.

Now, go forth and quote. May the Force be with you, and may your matches be ever in your favor. And if all else fails, just remember: "You're gonna need a bigger boat." (For all those fish in the sea you're about to catch, of course.)
