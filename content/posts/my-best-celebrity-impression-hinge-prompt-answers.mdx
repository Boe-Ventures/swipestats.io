## **You're Ready to Impress... Or Something Like That**

Alright, hotshot. You've now got more celebrity impressions than a Vegas impersonator with a multiple personality disorder. If these don't get you matches, you might want to consider a career in ventriloquism instead.

Remember, the key to a great Hinge profile is being authentically you... even if "you" happens to be a spot-on impression of Christopher Walken reading erotic fiction.

Still not getting the matches you want? Maybe it's time for a **[profile revie**w](https://www.swipestats.io/products/dating-profile-review). Or, you know, therapy. Both work wonders.

Now go and swipe. May the force be with you, the odds be ever in your favor, and may you always follow your heart... but never forget to bring a towel.
