## Introduction

You've stared at that prompt for five minutes. "The way to win me over is..."

Your cursor blinks. You type something about being kind. Delete it. Try again with a joke about pizza. Delete that too. Eventually you settle on something generic that probably describes 40% of men on the app.

Then you get three matches all week.

Here's the thing: this prompt is one of [Hinge's most popular conversation starters](/blog/hinge-review), which means it shows up on thousands of profiles. Most answers blend together into a beige soup of "just be yourself" and "make me laugh" platitudes. The women you actually want to match with have seen them all.

We analyzed hundreds of successful Hinge profiles to figure out what actually works. The patterns are clear, repeatable, and honestly kind of simple once you see them.

**TL;DR: What Actually Works**

Authenticity beats cleverness. Specificity beats vagueness. Genuine vulnerability beats polished perfection. And if you sound like every other guy on the app, you'll get the same results as every other guy.

## What Makes a Great "The Way to Win Me Over Is" Answer?

The difference between an answer that gets ignored and one that sparks real conversation comes down to three things.

**First: Show what you actually value, not what sounds impressive.** The prompt is asking what matters to you, not what you think should matter to you. If you hate fancy dinners, don't pretend candlelit restaurants are the path to your heart. If intellectual conversation genuinely excites you more than anything else, say that. Women can smell inauthenticity faster than you'd think, and the moment they detect it, they're swiping left.

**Second: Be specific enough to spark conversation.** Vague answers close doors. Specific answers open them. There's a reason "make me laugh" doesn't work but "send me a meme you actually think is funny" does. One is something everyone could say. The other reveals something about how you operate.

**Third: Let your personality show through tone and word choice.** Your answer should sound like you talking to a friend, not like you writing a dating profile. If you're naturally self-deprecating, lean into that. If you're more earnest, own it. The goal isn't to be likeable to everyone. It's to be magnetic to the right people.

Here's a strong answer: "The way to win me over is to have a strong opinion about something that doesn't matter. Like bagels. Or which Wes Anderson movie is actually the best."

Why does this work? It signals that you value personality and playfulness. It shows you don't take yourself too seriously. It gives her something to respond to (she probably has opinions about bagels). It's specific without being demanding.

Compare that to: "The way to win me over is to be kind and funny and genuine." This could describe literally anyone. It creates nothing to grab onto.

## The Best "The Way to Win Me Over Is" Answers - Sincere & Genuine

If sincerity is your lane, lean all the way into it. Women looking for real connection don't want you pretending to be the class clown.

**"The way to win me over is to be honest about your life, even the messy parts. I don't need you to have it all figured out."**

This is powerful because it gives permission to be human. It attracts women who are tired of dating men trying to perform a perfect version of themselves. It signals vulnerability is safe with you.

## The Best "The Way to Win Me Over Is" Answers - Funny & Playful

If [humor is your natural language](/blog/best-rizz-pickup-lines), use it. Confidence and self-awareness come through in how you make jokes.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid When Answering This Prompt

Some answers don't just fail to generate matches. They actively repel good ones.

**Mistake 1: Asking for too much or being materialistic.**

"The way to win me over is to take me to expensive restaurants and buy me things" or "The way to win me over is to have a six-figure salary" immediately signals you're looking for a wallet, not a person. This attracts opportunistic matches and repels women looking for genuine connection.

Better: "The way to win me over is to take me somewhere you love, even if it's cheap. I want to see what matters to you."

**Mistake 2: Listing too many requirements.**

"The way to win me over is to be kind, funny, intelligent, adventurous, ambitious, emotionally available, good with kids, loves dogs, reads books, travels frequently, cooks well, and has perfect grammar."

Long lists overwhelm potential matches. They feel like a job description, not an invitation to connection. They also signal you're looking for a fantasy person, not a real human.

Better: Pick one or two things that genuinely matter. "The way to win me over is to care about something deeply. Doesn't matter what."

**Mistake 3: Being too generic or vague.**

"The way to win me over is to just be yourself and be nice." This applies to literally everyone on the app. It creates nothing to respond to. It signals you haven't thought much about what actually matters.

Better: Get specific. "The way to win me over is to have a terrible movie recommendation you actually stand behind."

**Mistake 4: Trying too hard to be clever or cheesy.**

"The way to win me over is to be my missing puzzle piece" or "The way to win me over is to be my ride or die" lands in cringe territory. It signals you're performing from a script you found online rather than saying something real.

Better: Be yourself. A simple, honest answer in your own voice beats a polished cliche every time.

## How to [Personalize These Answers for Your Profile](https://www.swipestats.io/products/dating-profile-review)

These examples are starting points, not finish lines. Here's how to make one work for your actual life.

**Strategy 1: Identify your core love language first.**

Are you someone who lights up from words of affirmation? Then "The way to win me over is to tell me specifically what you appreciate about me" makes sense. Do you run on acts of service? Then "The way to win me over is to show up and actually help with something that matters" fits better.

Your answer should reflect how you actually experience connection, not how you think you should want connection.

**Strategy 2: Mix categories across your profile.**

If your answer to this prompt is funny, maybe your answer to another prompt is sincere. If one answer is activity-focused, another can be emotional. This prevents you from seeming one-dimensional.

Most profiles lean too heavily in one direction. A guy who's funny in every answer seems like he can't be serious. A guy who's sincere in every answer seems boring. Variety signals depth.

**Strategy 3: Test multiple versions.**

You don't need to stick with the first answer that feels decent. Try different versions over a few weeks. See what resonates.

[Swipestats lets you track which of your answers actually generate matches](https://www.swipestats.io) and conversations. You can see real data about what's working instead of just guessing. Change your answer, track your match rate. It's the only way to know what's actually effective versus what just feels clever.

**Strategy 4: Use specific details about your actual life.**

"The way to win me over is to come to my favorite coffee shop with me" is more memorable than "The way to win me over is to enjoy good coffee." Specificity creates stickiness.

Mention your dog if you have one. Reference the bar you always go to. Allude to the weird hobby you actually have. These details make you real, not generic.

## Profile Optimization: Beyond Just This One Prompt

This prompt doesn't live in isolation. It works with your other answers to create a complete picture of who you are.

If this answer suggests you value adventure, your [photo strategy](/blog/dating-profile-photos-that-get-girls-to-notice-you) and other answers should back that up. If it signals you're thoughtful and emotionally intelligent, the rest of your profile should feel that way too.

The best profiles have coherence. Everything points in the same direction. Your photo, your bio, your answer to this prompt, your answer to "What's your ideal Sunday?" all tell the same story about who you are and what kind of person would actually fit with you.

The women responding to your best answers are the ones who already sense compatibility from multiple signals in your profile. This prompt is just one piece of that puzzle.

## Common Follow-Up Questions About This Prompt

**Should I be funny or serious?**

Whichever one is actually you. A serious guy forcing humor comes across as trying too hard. A naturally funny guy being serious feels inauthentic. Pick the lane you actually live in.

**What if I don't know what wins me over yet?**

That's okay. Think about the last time someone made you feel genuinely good. What did they do? That's your answer. Or think about what annoyed you in past relationships. The opposite of that probably wins you over.

**Should I mention dealbreakers or red flags?**

No. This prompt is about what you value, not what you hate. Dealbreakers are necessary later in dating, but not here. This is about attraction, not repulsion.

**How honest should I really be?**

Completely honest. The point of online dating is to filter for compatibility as early as possible. If your real answer scares someone away, that's actually working correctly. You want someone who genuinely resonates with who you actually are.

**Can I change my answer periodically?**

Yes. Your Hinge profile isn't a legal document. You can rotate in different answers every few weeks to keep your profile fresh and to test what works best. Just make sure whatever you use is authentic.

## Ready to Optimize Your Hinge Profile?

The core principles are simple: authenticity beats cleverness, specificity beats vagueness, and vulnerability beats polish.

Your answer to "The way to win me over is" should reflect what you genuinely value and invite the right person to connect with you. It should sound like you, not like you recycled something from the internet.

Here's where most guys get stuck: they write an answer they think will appeal to the most women, not an answer that's actually true. Then they get confused why their matches don't feel like real connections.

The best answer is one that feels true. Everything else is optimization.

That said, you should know what's actually working. Swipestats tracks which of your answers generate the most matches and conversations. You can see exactly how your profile performs over time. You can identify patterns: which answers get responses, which ones sit silent, which ones attract quality matches versus quantity.

This is data-driven dating. Instead of guessing what works, you can see it.

Start with an answer that's true to who you are. See how it performs. Adjust. Test again. The best version of your profile emerges from this kind of experimentation, not from perfection in the first draft.

Go write something real. Then measure what happens.
