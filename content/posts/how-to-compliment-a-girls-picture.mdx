## What is a Good Compliment for a Girl's Picture?

Telling her "nice pic" is about as original as a fart in an elevator. If you want to get her attention, you've got to put in some damn effort.

### **Don't Make Things All About Looks**

Sure, she's hot, but there's more to life than being a shallow prick.

Comments like "Your smile brightens my day more than a rainbow" sound like they were written by a 13-year-old emo kid after getting dumped. And "Your sense of humor is sharper than a katana"? What is this, a line from a rejected Steven Seagal movie?

That try-hard, pseudo-deep sh\*t might impress the baristas at your local coffee shop's open mic night. But an actual woman is just gonna cringe and roll her eyes harder than a stoned raccoon.

**Here's how you can do it better:**

While the Tinderbros all spam Lisa with "DAAAMN GURL 🔥🔥" like mouth-breathing troglodytes, Marcus chimes in with "Your positive energy is more uplifting than Tony Robbins dropping acid. You radiate so much light, queen." Lisa's ovaries explode at being seen as a full human.

### **Pay Attention to the Details**

Don't just glaze over the photo like a brain-dead chimp. Notice the little things, like the color of her dress or that dope necklace she's rocking.

"That yellow dress makes your eyes pop more than a can of Pringles" shows you're observant and not just focused on her cleavage like every other dickhead.

**For example:**

John spots Sara's pic at the coffee shop. Instead of some lazy shit like "u look hot", he says "Damn, your latte art game is strong. Almost as fire as that yellow sundress." Sara's immediately intrigued by someone who's not a total mouth-breather.

### **Always Be Genuine**

Authenticity beats rehearsed bullshit any day. If she's got a nice smile, don't spew some cringeworthy line you read on Reddit. Just say "Your smile is more contagious than the f\*cking plague."

Genuine comments hit different and can actually lead somewhere.

**For example:**

Emma posts a pic of her hiking adventure. Most guys hit her with "nice pic" or "great view" like they're actually bots. But then Steve drops a "Your adventurous spirit is inspiring as hell. That hike looks tougher than my uncle's steak, but you crushed it." Emma's panties flood with appreciation for such a genuine, non-thirsty compliment.

## **How to Compliment Her Hair**

When it comes to her hair, be specific. Don't just blurt out "nice hair" like an awkward preteen. Try "Your curls give you that vibrant look 👌"

Mention the effort she puts in to not look busted.

**For example:**

Samantha gets a fresh cut and posts a selfie. The usual losers hit her with "cute" or "pretty". But then Chad arrives with "Your new 'do is straight fire, girl. It's like it was designed to show off that beautiful mug of yours." Samantha swoons over someone who notices details instead of just objectifying her.

## **How to Compliment Her Style**

Complimenting her style shows you're not just focused on her body. "You've got style for days, that outfit belongs on the cover of Vogue" or "Your outfits are always so unique, it's like you're a trendsetter."

**For example:**

Mike spots Anna's pic in a killer outfit. He drops a "Holy shit, your style is impeccable. You look like you just walked off a magazine cover. So damn fresh." Anna is stunned by someone who appreciates her fashion sense instead of just making it about her curves.

## **Mention Something That Reminded You of Her**

This one's smooth as hell. If you saw something that reminded you of her, let her know. "I saw a painting today that captured the same spirit as your travel photos" or "That sunset shot looked just like the one you took on our road trip."

It shows you're thinking about her when she's not around.

**For example:**

David's at an art gallery and sees a painting that reminds him of Jenny's travel pics. He hits her up with "Yo, I just saw a dope painting that gave me the same vibe as that amazing mountain shot you took. Made me think of your adventurous ass." Jenny melts over someone who makes thoughtful connections.

## **Send Her a Flirty Compliment**

Flirty banter is an art, and most guys are absolute shit at it. Cringy lines like "Did it just get hot in here?" belong in the god damn dumpster. If you want to spice things up, you need originality and smooth confidence.

**For example:**

Alex spots Rachel's new fire selfie and instead of the usual lame lines, he slides in with "Damn girl, you're making the sun look f\*cking irrelevant with that heat 😍" Rachel instantly feels that spark of intrigue at someone who can flirt without being a corny douchebag.

## **Compliments for Tinder**

Tinder is a cesspool of lame openers. Stand out with:

- "You've got a presence I haven't seen on this fucking app yet."
- "Your profile is a breath of fresh air compared to all these basic bitches."
- "That black dress looks sexy as hell on you. Classy and fire at the same time."
  **For example:**

Tom swipes on Claire and instead of the usual "hey" bullshit, he hits her with "Your profile is like a cool breeze through this stale-ass app. That black dress looks unreal on you, by the way." Claire is instantly intrigued by some non-douchey game.

## **Funny Tinder Compliments**

Humor is always panty-melting when executed right. But most guys' idea of "funny" is some corny-ass line like "Are you a time traveler? Cuz I see you in my future." Might as well just light your chances on fire with that kind of cringe.

If you want to use humor to grab her attention, you need originality and confidence. Shit like "If you were a vegetable, you'd be a cute-cumber" is barely even dad joke levels of funny.

**For example**

Jake could have opened with some dusty "Do you have a map?" line that every other numbnuts uses. But instead, he hits Emma with "Your eyes are so gorgeous, I forgot how to fucking speak for a second there." Emma busts out laughing at the unexpectedly smooth-yet-silly line and fires back with her own zinger. Just like that, the ice is shattered.

## More Compliment Examples That Don't Completely Suck

## **Looks**

- "Your eyes are so hypnotic, black holes are probably taking notes."
- "You've got an elegant presence that would make Audrey Hepburn look busted as hell."
- "Your smile is like the first ray of sunshine after an apocalyptic month of storms and misery."

## **Hair**

- "Your hair looks like it belongs in a Pantene commercial directed by Tarantino. Straight killer."
- "I love how your hair falls with that IDGAF, naturally gorgeous flow."
- "That new hairstyle frames your face so perfectly, the Renaissance artists are punching air."

## **Style**

- "That jacket you're rocking is straight lava. Your taste is making the fashion world obsolete."
- "Your outfit makes you look like an actual royal queen who bangs on the regular."
- "You've cracked the code on looks that are stylish yet comfy enough to rob a bank in."

## **Personal**

- "I saw a sunset today that reminded me of that mind-blowing one you captured. Equally panty-dropping."
- "That pic with your pup is so heartwarming, it's proof you've got a beautiful soul and body."
- "Your adventurous spirit shines so bright in that photo, it makes my couch potato life seem pathetic."

## **Flirty**

- "I'm calling the authorities, because you look illegally sexy and dangerous in that photo."
- "Is it even legal to look that lethally good? You're definitely an arrestable offender."
- "How do you make even simple shit look extraordinarily, unfairly gorgeous? It's a crime."

## **Funny**

- "Do you have a Band-Aid? Because I totally busted my knee falling for your irresistible charm."
- "Are you a Wi-Fi signal? Because I'm definitely feeling some intense, undeniable connection here."
- "Did you get a sunburn or are you just naturally that scorching hot without trying?"

## **Bonus**

- "The way you captured that moment is straight-up cinematic brilliance. Tarantino could never."
- "You've got this magical talent for making everyday mundane stuff look like art."
- "Your pic has this serene, peaceful Renaissance vibe that's a retreat from this shitshow world."
  Use these unique compliments to grab her attention without sounding like every other cringey bastard out there. Be bold, be funny, be authentic - but most importantly, don't be a boring, uninspired dumpster fire.
