## How Raya Works

Raya is a dating app that makes the velvet rope at an A-list Hollywood party look like a welcome mat at your local dive bar. It's the digital equivalent of a secret society for the beautiful, the famous, and the disgustingly successful.

Launched in 2015, Raya quickly became the go-to app for celebrities and influencers looking to mingle with their own kind, away from the prying eyes of the paparazzi and thirsty fans.

### How is Raya different from other dating apps?

While apps like [Tinder](https://www.swipestats.io/blog/tinder-review) and [Bumble](https://www.swipestats.io/blog/bumble-review) let anyone with a pulse and a selfie join, Raya has an application process that would make Harvard admissions officers break out in a cold sweat.

It's not about how many fish pics you have or how witty your bio is; it's about who you know, what you've achieved, and whether you're interesting enough to join their exclusive club.

Raya's approach to matchmaking is more akin to a high-end matchmaking service than a typical swipe-based app. The focus is on quality over quantity, with a curated selection of potential matches presented to users daily.

This approach aims to create meaningful connections rather than encouraging endless swiping.

### Raya's user base: The A-list crowd

Picture a digital cocktail party where every attendee has either graced a magazine cover, founded a startup, or has more Instagram followers than the population of a small country.

That's Raya's user base in a nutshell. From actors and musicians to entrepreneurs and athletes, it's a melting pot of success and influence in the creative industries.

The app has been linked to numerous celebrity users, including Amy Schumer, Channing Tatum, and Demi Lovato. While these high-profile users add to the app's allure, they also contribute to its air of mystery and exclusivity.

It's not uncommon for users to spot familiar faces from TV, movies, or social media while browsing through potential matches.

## Pros & Cons of Raya

### Pros:

- Exclusive community: Rub virtual shoulders with the elite and accomplished, potentially expanding your professional network while searching for love.
- Privacy-focused: Your profile is safer than Fort Knox, perfect for the privacy-conscious celeb or anyone who values discretion in their dating life.
- High-quality matches: Say goodbye to catfishes and hello to verified hotties. Each profile is thoroughly vetted, reducing the chance of fake accounts or scams.
- Unique features: Like a digital concierge service for your love life, Raya offers personalized assistance and curated matches.
- Global network: Connect with elite singles worldwide, because why limit yourself to local celebrities when you can date internationally?
- Networking opportunities: The app's dual-purpose nature allows for both romantic and professional connections, potentially opening doors in your career.

### Cons:

- Extremely selective: Getting in is harder than scoring tickets to the Met Gala. The acceptance rate is rumored to be around 8%, making it more exclusive than some Ivy League schools.
- High subscription cost: Your wallet might feel lighter than your ego after paying for membership, especially if you're not making regular connections.
- Limited user base: Exclusivity means fewer fish in the sea, even if they're all marlins. This can lead to a quick exhaustion of potential matches.
- Potential for elitism: The app's focus on status and achievement may foster an environment that values superficial qualities over genuine connections.
- Lengthy application process: Be prepared to wait weeks or even months for a decision on your application, which can be frustrating for those eager to start dating.

## Who Is Raya For?

## Key Features of Raya

### Rigorous Application Process

Raya's application process is more selective than a Michelin-star restaurant's menu. It involves a combination of algorithmic and human screening, considering factors like Instagram following, career accomplishments, and personal connections.

This feature ensures that only the crème de la crème makes it through, maintaining the app's exclusivity.

The application requires potential members to provide their Instagram handle, occupation, and referrals from existing Raya members.

An anonymous committee then reviews each application, considering factors such as the applicant's Instagram influence, professional achievements, and overall "cool factor."

### Instagram Integration

Unlike other dating apps where you might struggle to showcase your best self, Raya lets you connect your Instagram account.

This feature allows you to curate a slideshow of your most impressive moments, set to music of your choice. It's like creating a mini-movie trailer of your life – perfect for capturing the attention of other elite singles.

The Instagram integration goes beyond just displaying your photos. It allows for a more dynamic and engaging profile that can showcase your lifestyle, interests, and achievements in a way that static photos and text can't match.

### Global Networking

Raya isn't just for finding your next A-list romance; it's also a platform for professional networking in creative industries. The app allows you to switch between dating and networking modes, making it easier to connect with industry peers or potential collaborators.

This unique feature sets Raya apart from typical dating apps, offering value beyond just romantic connections.

The networking feature has led to various collaborations and business partnerships among members, making Raya a valuable tool for career advancement in addition to dating.

### Privacy Controls

Privacy is paramount on Raya, and the app takes it seriously. Users have strict control over their visibility and can choose to hide their profiles from certain members.

Additionally, screenshots are strictly prohibited, with potential account termination for those who violate this rule. This feature makes Raya a safe haven for high-profile individuals who value their privacy.

The app also employs geolocation features that allow users to see who else is nearby, but only if both parties agree to share their location. This adds an extra layer of privacy and control.

### Concierge Service

Raya offers a personalized concierge service to help users navigate the app and make meaningful connections. This white-glove treatment is a standout feature, providing a level of customer service that matches the app's elite status.

The concierge can assist with everything from profile optimization to suggesting potential matches based on your preferences and interests.

## Sign-Up Process & Creating a Profile

1. Download the Raya app from the App Store (sorry Android users, it's iOS only for now).
2. Fill out the comprehensive application form, including details about your career, Instagram handle, and referrals from existing Raya members.
3. Wait patiently (or not so patiently) for the anonymous committee to review your application – this can take weeks or even months.
4. If accepted (and only about 8% of applicants are), pay the membership fee to activate your account.
5. Set up your profile by selecting your best photos and creating a slideshow set to music of your choice.
6. Write a brief bio that showcases your personality and achievements without coming across as boastful.
7. Link your Instagram account to provide additional context to your profile.
8. Start connecting with other elite singles and expanding your network in both dating and professional modes.

## Raya Costs

Raya operates on a subscription model, with costs that reflect its exclusive nature:

- Monthly membership: $9.99
- 6-month membership: $59.99 ($9.99 per month)
  While these prices might seem reasonable compared to other dating apps, remember that you're paying for exclusivity and the chance to connect with high-profile individuals. The real cost is in meeting Raya's strict admission criteria.

Additional features or in-app purchases:

- Currently, Raya doesn't offer additional paid features beyond the basic subscription. The focus is on providing a uniform, high-quality experience for all members.
  Is it worth it? If you're part of the elite crowd Raya caters to and value privacy and quality social connections, the price tag is likely justifiable. The potential for both romantic and professional networking opportunities can make the subscription fee a worthwhile investment.

For the average Joe or Jane, however, the cost might be moot since getting accepted is the real challenge.

## How Swipestats Rates Raya

Overall verdict: Raya earns a solid 3.5 out of 5 stars. It's a unique platform that delivers on its promise of exclusive connections, but its limited accessibility and potentially small dating pool keep it from a higher score.

### Attractiveness of the members: 5/5

When it comes to the attractiveness of Raya members, we're talking about a pool that would make even the most glamorous red carpet events look mundane. The app is teeming with models, actors, and influencers who could easily grace magazine covers.

Compared to other apps, Raya is in a league of its own in terms of user attractiveness. However, it's worth noting that "attractiveness" here often correlates with conventional standards of beauty and success in creative industries.

### User base: 3/5

While Raya's user base isn't as vast as mainstream apps, it makes up for quantity with quality. The app boasts a diverse range of accomplished individuals from various creative industries.

However, the exclusivity means you might encounter the same faces more frequently than on other apps, which could be a drawback for some users.

The global nature of the app does help to expand the pool, but it's still relatively small compared to mainstream dating apps.

### Match rate: 4/5

From personal experience, the match rate on Raya tends to be higher than on typical dating apps. This is likely due to the curated user base and the fact that members are generally more engaged.

However, don't expect an overwhelming flood of matches – quality over quantity is the name of the game here.

The smaller user base means you might run out of potential matches quicker than on other apps, especially if you're in a less populated area.

### Pricing: 4/5

Raya's pricing is surprisingly reasonable given its exclusive nature. At $9.99 per month, it's on par with or even cheaper than some mainstream dating apps.

Considering the caliber of connections you can make, both romantic and professional, the price seems justified for those who can get past the stringent application process.

However, the real cost is the time and effort required to be accepted into the app's elite community. For those who do gain access, the value proposition can be high, especially if you're looking to expand your network in creative industries.
