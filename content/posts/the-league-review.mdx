- **Biggest pros:** Curated matches, professional crowd, privacy features, and fewer time-wasters.
- **Biggest cons:** Excruciatingly long waitlist, eye-watering monthly membership fees, limited daily matches, and a potential echo chamber of similar personalities.

## How Does The League Work?

The League is a dating app that's about as exclusive as the secret menu at In-N-Out Burger – everyone knows about it, but not everyone gets to experience it.

Launched in 2015 by Amanda Bradford, this app aims to be the Ivy League of the dating world, connecting ambitious professionals with equally driven partners.

Picture a digital bouncer scrutinizing every aspect of your life before deciding if you're worthy of entry. You submit an application, which includes linking your LinkedIn and Facebook profiles, and then you wait. And wait. And maybe wait some more.

### How is The League different from other dating apps?

While Tinder and Bumble are the all-you-can-eat buffets of the dating world, The League is more like a Michelin-starred restaurant with a six-month waiting list. It's not about quantity; it's about quality – or at least, their definition of quality.

The app uses an algorithm to screen applicants based on their education, professional achievements, and social network. Once you're in, you're treated to a daily "Happy Hour" where you receive a curated selection of profiles.

It's like The Hunger Games, but instead of fighting for your life, you're competing for a chance at love with someone who probably also thinks they're too good for regular dating apps.

### The League's User Base

The League's users are typically high-achieving professionals in their late 20s to early 40s.

We're talking lawyers who argue cases by day and their relationship status by night, doctors who can perform heart surgery but can't seem to mend their own, and tech entrepreneurs who can code an app but can't decode their love life.

The average user has at least a bachelor's degree, with many boasting advanced degrees. They're career-focused, ambitious, and probably have a strong opinion about whether pineapple belongs on pizza (it doesn't, fight me).

In major cities like New York, San Francisco, and London, you'll find a diverse mix of industries represented. But let's be real – finance bros and tech geeks tend to dominate.

## Pros & Cons of The League

### Pros:

- Curated potential matches: The League's algorithm does the heavy lifting, presenting you with a handful of successful matches each day. It's quality over quantity, which means less time swiping and more time connecting.
- Professional crowd: Say goodbye to "u up?" texts at 2 AM and hello to "Want to discuss the implications of the latest Fed rate hike over coffee?" messages.
- Privacy features: Your profile is only visible to other verified members, which means your boss or employees won't stumble upon your dating profile unless they're also on The League.
- Video chat option: Test the waters with a virtual date before committing to an in-person meeting.
- Transparent match stats: The app provides insights into your performance, including how often your profile is viewed and your match rate.
- League Groups: Join virtual groups based on shared interests, allowing you to connect with like-minded individuals beyond just romantic prospects.

### Cons:

- Long waitlist: The League's waitlist can be excruciatingly long, especially in smaller cities.
- Expensive membership: If you thought your college tuition was steep, wait until you see The League's membership fees.
- Limited daily matches: Free users get only a handful of matches per day, which can make the process feel painfully slow.
- Potential for elitism: The app's focus on professional and educational achievements can create an echo chamber of similar personalities and backgrounds.
- High pressure: With such an emphasis on status and achievement, users might feel the need to constantly prove their worth, turning dating into another job interview.
- Technical issues: Some users report frequent glitches and crashes, which is frustrating when you're paying premium prices for a premium experience.

## Who Is The League For?

### The League is for you if:

- You have more letters after your name than in it, and you're not afraid to humble-brag about it.
- Your idea of slumming it is flying business instead of first class.
- You're tired of explaining to dates what private equity actually means (and why it's not as exciting as it sounds).
- You believe love and career success aren't mutually exclusive, and you're looking for a partner who feels the same.
- You're willing to invest time and money into finding a relationship with someone who matches your ambition and drive.
- You value privacy and prefer a more curated dating experience over the free-for-all of mainstream apps.

### It's not for you if:

- You think a blue-collar job involves wearing a navy shirt to the office.
- Your idea of networking is adding your pizza delivery guy on Facebook.
- You're looking for a quick hookup or casual dating scene. This isn't Tinder, folks.
- You're on a budget and think spending more than $10 on a dating app is highway robbery.
- You value diversity in your dating pool and prefer to meet people from all walks of life.
- You're not comfortable linking your professional life to your dating life.
- You need instant gratification and get frustrated by limited daily matches.

## Key and Special Features of The League

### The Waiting List

Ah, The League's infamous waiting list – it's like purgatory for the dating elite. The wait time can vary dramatically, from a few days to several months, depending on factors like your location, education, profession, and possibly how much the algorithm likes your face.

Pro tip: Referrals from existing members can speed up the process. Time to call in those favors from your well-connected friends!

### League Groups

This feature allows you to join virtual groups based on shared interests, hobbies, or industries. It's like a high school club fair, but with less acne and more stock options.

### League Live

Introduced in 2019, League Live is a video dating feature that's about as awkward as your first school dance, but potentially more rewarding. Every Sunday night, the app will match you with up to three prospective partners for a series of two-minute video chats.

### Power Moves

This premium feature lets you rematch with expired connections, see who's viewed your profile, and set advanced preferences for your perfect matches.

### The League Score

This mysterious algorithm rates your profile's attractiveness and overall quality. It's about as transparent as your company's HR policies but supposedly helps improve your matching odds.

## Sign-Up Process & Creating a Profile

1. Download the app and provide basic info like name, gender, and preferences.
2. Link your Facebook and LinkedIn profiles. Yes, they're that nosy.
3. Upload your best photos. The League allows up to six high-quality photos, and they have strict guidelines. No sunglasses, no group shots, no bathroom selfies.
4. Write a bio that showcases your wit and accomplishments in 140 characters or less. It's like Twitter, but the stakes are higher.
5. Set your preferences. Be as picky as you want – this is your chance to filter by age, height, education, ethnicity, religion, and more.
6. Join the waitlist and pray to the dating gods for swift approval.
7. Once approved, you'll start receiving daily matches during the app's "Happy Hour" at 5 PM local time.

## The League Costs

Brace yourselves, because The League's pricing might just make you consider a second job. Here's the breakdown of the membership perks:

- Free membership: Limited to 3 potential partners or matches per day. You can view profiles, send messages, and join League Groups, but that's about it.
- Member ($99/month): More daily prospects, access to video chat features, expedited profile review, and the ability to see who's viewed your profile.
- Owner ($249/month): All Member perks plus profile boosts, VIP passes to skip the waitlist, and the ability to see all your prospects' profile information at once.
- Investor ($999/month): For those who think money can buy love (or at least more matches). You get all the Owner perks plus additional perks. These include two profile boosts per day, five VIP passes per month, and access to exclusive events.
  Is it worth it? Well, that depends on how much you value your time and how serious you are about finding a life partner who matches your ambition and success.

But for most people, it's a steep price for what's essentially a more polished Tinder.

## How Swipestats Rates The League

**Overall verdict: 3.5/5**

The League offers a unique, elite dating experience, but its exclusivity and high price tag may be off-putting for many. It's like a designer handbag – nice to have, but not necessary for everyone.

### Attractiveness of the users: 4/5

The League boasts an undeniably attractive user base. These are people who take care of themselves and have the means to do so. Expect well-groomed professionals with winning smiles and carefully curated photos.

### User base: 3/5

While the quality is high, quantity is an issue. The League's exclusivity means fewer users overall, especially in smaller cities. You might find yourself running out of options faster than you can say "venture capital."

### Match rate: 3.5/5

The match rate on The League is decent, thanks to its curated approach. However, with limited daily matches, it can feel slow-paced. Quality over quantity is the name of the game here, but it might test your patience if you're used to the rapid-fire and endless swiping of other apps.

### Pricing: 2.5/5

Let's not sugarcoat it – The League is expensive. While the premium features are nice, the pricing is steep enough to make even a Wall Street banker think twice. It's a significant investment in your love life.
