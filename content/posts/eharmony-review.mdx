<TLDR>

### **TL;DR: Quick Summary**

**The Bottom Line:** eHarmony is genuinely good if you're marriage-minded with money to burn. But at $300-900 for 6-12 months paid upfront, it's the most expensive mainstream dating app. The compatibility system works better than swiping, and the user base is serious, but the paywall is aggressive as hell.

**Our Score:** 3.5/5 - Excellent for marriage-minded daters with budget, expensive and slow for everyone else

**Best For:** Singles 30-55 seeking marriage, willing to invest serious time and money, prefer algorithm matching over endless swiping

**Biggest Pros:** High-quality serious users, sophisticated compatibility matching backed by 25+ years of data, lowest fake profile rate, strong marriage track record

**Biggest Cons:** Most expensive major dating app ($45-75/month), 30-45 minute mandatory questionnaire, can't see photos or message without paying, difficult cancellation process

**Cost Reality:** $270-1080 paid upfront depending on subscription length. Free version is basically useless.

</TLDR>

I tested eHarmony for several weeks because I kept hearing two completely different stories. Half the internet claims it's the gold standard for finding serious relationships. The other half says it's an overpriced scam that traps you in expensive contracts.

Here's what I actually found after spending way too much time (and money) on this thing.

## What the Hell Is eHarmony Anyway?

<a href="https://tms.eharmony.com/cl?m315=c&q=o1dSHENv8YsxD7CzcHkn0jqQ" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank">eHarmony</a> launched in 2000, which makes it ancient by dating app standards. A Christian psychologist named Dr. Neil Clark Warren created it based on his work with married couples. The religious roots still show in the user base, though the company went mainstream years ago.

Unlike every other dating app where you mindlessly swipe through faces, eHarmony forces you through an 80+ question personality assessment before you see a single match. Then their algorithm spits out "compatible" profiles based on 25+ years of relationship data they've collected.

No swiping. No browsing. You get the matches their system thinks will work, and that's it.

The whole thing is built around their proprietary Compatibility Matching System (yes, they trademarked it). You answer questions about everything from conflict resolution style to whether you squeeze toothpaste from the middle or end. Then you get compatibility scores across personality fundamentals, relationship behavior, everyday life, and communication style.

It's now owned by the same parent company as Tinder, which is fucking ironic considering Tinder is the exact opposite of everything eHarmony stands for.

### How Is This Different From Just Swiping on Tinder?

The difference is night and day.

On [Tinder or Bumble](/blog/tinder-review), you see a photo, read a half-assed bio if you're lucky, and swipe based on whether you'd hook up with them. On eHarmony, you can't even see clear photos without paying, and the whole system is designed to match you based on compatibility factors that actually matter for long-term relationships.

They use something called "Guided Communication" where you can't just immediately message someone. You start with pre-written icebreaker questions, then exchange deal-breakers, then answer deeper questions together, THEN you can finally chat freely. It feels restrictive as hell initially, but it does force actual conversation instead of "hey" followed by ghosting.

You also get detailed breakdowns of why you supposedly match with someone. Instead of "they're hot and nearby," you see percentages across different compatibility dimensions. It's more like LinkedIn than Tinder, which sounds boring but works better for finding someone you won't want to murder after three months.

The user base skews 30-55, more educated, more serious about relationships, and frankly more boring than free apps. Which is exactly the point.

### Who Actually Uses This Thing?

People who are done fucking around.

The typical eHarmony user is in their 30s-50s, has their shit together financially, tried the free apps and hated them, and wants to get married within the next 1-2 years. Not "eventually someday." Like, actually soon.

The high price naturally filters out broke college kids, people just looking to hook up, and anyone not genuinely invested in finding a serious relationship. Whether that's worth $300-900 is debatable, but it does create a more serious dating pool.

During my testing, nearly every profile I saw had detailed answers to prompts, multiple high-quality photos, and clear statements about wanting marriage and kids (or not wanting more kids). Compare this to Tinder where half the profiles say "just here for a good time" and the other half have three blurry group photos with no bio.

The gender ratio is relatively balanced, which matters more than people think. The user base is predominantly white and tends conservative politically, though that varies by location.

Free members can technically exist on the platform, but they see blurred photos and can't message anyone. So the actual active user base is entirely paid members who've invested hundreds of dollars, which again filters for seriousness.

## The Good and Bad Shit About eHarmony

### What Actually Works

**The user base is legitimately serious.** I cannot overstate this difference. On Hinge, maybe 30% of matches actually want a relationship despite what their profiles claim. On eHarmony, it's closer to 90%. People who drop $500 on a dating app are not there to waste time. The lengthy sign-up process also filters out anyone not willing to invest effort upfront.

**The compatibility matching is real.** After 25+ years and millions of relationships, their algorithm has actual data behind it. Harvard and University of Chicago research found eHarmony couples report higher marriage rates and satisfaction than other platforms. During testing, my high compatibility matches (80+%) had noticeably better conversation quality and aligned values compared to the 60-70% matches.

**Barely any fake profiles or scammers.** The high cost, SMS verification, and manual photo approval process keep most bullshit out. I saw zero obvious fakes during my testing. Compare this to POF or Tinder where you encounter bots constantly. The Trust and Safety team apparently removes suspicious accounts within 24 hours, and it shows.

**You get real insight into compatibility before meeting.** The detailed personality breakdowns, answered prompts, and compatibility scores give you information that would take 3-5 dates to learn organically. You can see deal-breakers upfront instead of wasting weeks on someone fundamentally incompatible.

**Quality beats quantity.** You get fewer matches, but the ones you get are thoughtfully selected. No more scrolling through hundreds of mediocre profiles. Whether this is "good" depends on your personality, but for people with decision fatigue from swipe apps, it's refreshing.

**Comprehensive profiles show actual personality.** Users answer extensive prompts about values, lifestyle, relationship goals, communication style. You see genuine human beings instead of carefully curated highlight reels. The profiles read more like journal entries than Instagram bios.

### What's Complete Garbage

**It's insanely fucking expensive.** This is the dealbreaker for most people. At $45-75/month on 6-month plans or $300-900 paid upfront for longer commitments, eHarmony costs more than most people's gym memberships. You can get Netflix, Spotify, and a gym membership for less than one month of eHarmony. The pricing actively excludes great people who simply can't afford it or can't justify spending rent money on a dating app.

**The free version is straight-up predatory.** You can't see clear photos. You can't send messages. You can't do anything useful except stare at blurred faces and feel frustrated. It's designed entirely to push you toward paying. Other apps have usable free tiers. eHarmony's free version is basically a 45-minute ad after the questionnaire.

**The initial time commitment is brutal.** 30-45 minutes for the personality questionnaire alone, then another 15-30 minutes completing your profile. That's over an hour before you even see a single match. If you have ADHD or just hate surveys, you'll want to throw your phone across the room. You also can't save progress easily and come back later.

**You can't browse freely.** You get the matches the algorithm gives you. That's it. Basic members can't even filter by distance beyond state level. If you like having control over who you see, this will drive you insane. The "What If?" discovery feature helps a bit but it's still limited compared to real browsing.

**Cancellation is a nightmare.** BBB complaints consistently mention difficulty canceling and unexpected charges. Auto-renewal is default. Even when you cancel, you owe the full contract amount. If you buy a 12-month plan and hate it after one month, tough shit, you're paying for all 12. Some states have 3-day cancellation windows but most don't.

**Limited match pool in smaller markets.** If you live in NYC or LA, fine. If you live in Wyoming, you might get 2-3 matches per month. The algorithm can't create compatible people who don't exist in your area. And Basic members only get state-level matching, which means someone 6 hours away might show up as a "match."

## Who Should Actually Use This

### Use eHarmony If...

You're genuinely ready to get married within 1-2 years. Not "I'd like to find someone eventually." Like, you're actively planning a life partner situation and ready to commit.

You can afford $300-900 without financial stress. If dropping $500 on a dating app means you can't pay rent or buy groceries, absolutely do not use eHarmony. There are cheaper options that work.

You tried free apps and hated the casual hookup culture, flaky behavior, and people who can't communicate beyond memes.

You're 30+ years old. The user base skews older. If you're 23, you'll have better luck on [Hinge or Bumble](/blog/hinge-review) where your age group actually hangs out.

You value depth over breadth. You'd rather have 5 high-quality matches than 500 mediocre ones. You like structure and don't mind letting an algorithm do the work.

You have patience for a methodical, slow process. eHarmony is not fast. It's designed for people building foundations, not chasing sparks.

### Skip eHarmony If...

You want to casually date and "see what happens." This app is expensive as hell for low-commitment exploration. Use Hinge or Bumble's free versions instead.

You can't afford it without sacrificing other financial priorities. No dating app is worth going into debt or skipping bills.

You're under 25. The user base doesn't match your demographic. You'll feel out of place.

You need to try before you buy. The free version is useless, and you can't get a real 30-day trial. You're committing $300+ upfront sight unseen.

You live in a small town or rural area. Unless you're willing to drive 2+ hours for dates, the match pool will be too small.

You want LGBTQ+ inclusive features beyond basic binary options. While they now technically include nonbinary, the platform is built around traditional relationship models.

You hate questionnaires and structured processes. The entire platform is surveys and guided steps. If that sounds like torture, it is.

## The Features That Actually Matter

### Compatibility Matching System

This is the whole reason eHarmony exists. You spend 30-45 minutes answering questions about emotional temperament, social style, relationship values, lifestyle preferences, conflict resolution, communication patterns, and personality traits. The system analyzes this against 25+ years of data from millions of relationships to find compatible matches.

You get a compatibility score out of 100+ for each match, broken down across four areas: personality fundamentals (emotional temperament, social style), relationship behavior (adaptability, conflict resolution), everyday life (values, lifestyle), and communication style (intellectual style, affection expression).

During testing, I found the 80+ compatibility matches genuinely had better conversation quality and shared values compared to 60-70% matches. The breakdown also helped identify potential friction points before meeting. If someone scored low on "affection expression" and I need physical touch, that's valuable information upfront.

Whether the algorithm is magic or just confirmation bias, it does seem to work better than "they're hot and nearby."

### Guided Communication

Instead of immediately opening messages, eHarmony walks you through structured steps: First, send pre-written icebreaker questions from a list. Second, exchange "Must Haves and Can't Stands" lists (deal-breakers). Third, answer deeper questions together. Finally, unlock open messaging.

You can skip straight to messaging if both people agree, but the default path forces meaningful interaction.

This feels annoyingly restrictive at first. You just want to message someone and the app makes you jump through hoops. But it does prevent the "hey" followed by silence cycle. It also helps people who struggle with conversation starters or don't know what to ask early on.

The downside is it adds time and friction. If someone doesn't respond to your icebreaker questions, you're stuck. You can't just send a regular message to spark things.

### What If? Discovery Feature

This is eHarmony's version of browsing. You see profiles outside your normal match criteria and can like or pass. It's more visual than regular matches and gives you some control instead of only seeing algorithm picks.

However, these profiles still must meet basic criteria like location and age range. You're not truly browsing freely like on other apps. Free members see blurred photos here too, so it's useless without premium.

During testing, I found What If? matches less compatible on average than regular algorithm matches, but it did surface a few interesting profiles I wouldn't have seen otherwise.

### Video Date and Secure Call Features

You can video chat or voice call directly in the app without sharing your phone number. This was added during COVID and stuck around.

For safety-conscious daters, this is huge. You can verify someone is real, assess chemistry, and have meaningful conversations before sharing contact information or meeting in person. It also weeds out catfishers who refuse to video chat.

The features work smoothly across devices without needing Zoom or FaceTime. Your actual phone number stays hidden.

### Profile Prompts and Depth

Beyond the matching questionnaire, you answer 2+ required prompts (500 characters max) from options like "The most important thing I'm looking for is..." or "I feel most loved when...". You also complete sections on interests, values, lifestyle, habits, relationship history.

This creates much richer profiles than photo-based apps. You see who someone actually is instead of just curated selfies. The downside is it's more work upfront and reading profiles takes longer.

During testing, the detailed profiles helped me screen for compatibility before even matching. If someone's prompt answers revealed major value conflicts, I could pass without wasting time.

### Match Preferences and Filters

Basic members get extremely limited filtering. You can set state-level location and basic demographics, but that's it. Someone 6 hours away in your state will show up as a match.

Premium members can filter by specific distance, new members, compatibility score ranges, and other criteria. But filtering is still more limited than apps like Match. eHarmony wants you trusting their algorithm instead of creating a detailed checklist.

This bothered me. In a large state, "state-level matching" is useless. I don't want to date someone 8 hours away, but the Basic plan doesn't let you filter tighter.

## Setting Up Your Profile (The 1+ Hour Commitment)

Here's the actual process you'll go through:

**Step 1:** Download app or visit website. Select your country and gender. Options now include woman, man, and nonbinary, though the nonbinary option is relatively new and the interface still feels binary-focused.

**Step 2:** Select who you're open to meeting. You can choose men and/or women, though the interface makes it look single-choice initially. Not particularly inclusive for diverse orientations.

**Step 3:** Share relationship goals. Choose between casual, serious, or just browsing. The app is obviously built for "serious" so choosing "casual" feels pointless.

**Step 4:** Consent and data settings. Review a lengthy privacy policy. You can decline "accept all" and still proceed, which is nice compared to apps that force acceptance.

**Step 5:** Create account with email, Google, or Apple. Surprisingly no Facebook option.

**Step 6:** Begin the infamous Compatibility Quiz. This takes 30-45 minutes minimum. Questions cover ideal living situation, relationship motivations, current life situation, interests, personality traits, values, lifestyle, reactions to hypothetical scenarios, and a bunch of abstract preference questions.

The abstract section has you choose between shape pairs and images of homes or nature. It feels like a Rorschach test. I have no idea what my preference for circles over squares reveals about my relationship compatibility, but apparently it matters.

**Step 7:** Complete demographic information. Full name, birthday, occupation, height, education, income (optional but asked), children status, religion, ethnicity, marital status (single, separated, divorced, widowed).

**Step 8:** Write profile content. Select and answer 2+ prompts from a list (500 characters each). Write a bio. This takes another 15-30 minutes if you actually put effort in.

**Step 9:** Upload photos. Minimum 1 photo required, though you can technically skip this, which is a massive red flag for catfishing. Photos go through manual approval process, so they don't appear instantly. During testing, mine were approved within 2 hours.

**Step 10:** Receive matches. You're shown 3 "featured profiles" to rate before accessing the main match feed. This feels like conditioning you to judge profiles quickly.

**Step 11:** Hit the aggressive paywall. Every photo is blurred. Messaging is locked. You get a "Welcome Gift" offer for 50% off, which is really just the first installment discount, not 50% off the total price.

Total time from download to finished profile: 45-75 minutes. This is by far the longest sign-up process of any major dating app.

## What This Actually Costs (The Uncomfortable Truth)

Let's talk money. This is where eHarmony loses most people.

### The Pricing Breakdown

eHarmony doesn't advertise pricing clearly. You have to sign up, complete the questionnaire, and reach the paywall before seeing actual numbers. The prices below are based on 2026 rates I encountered during testing:

**Premium Light: $14.90/month**
- Unlimited messaging with 15 matches monthly (that's it, 15 total)
- See ONE photo per profile only
- Basic personality profile
- State-level location matching

This tier is nearly useless. 15 matches per month is nothing. Seeing only one photo per profile is absurd. This price is also the "50% off promotional rate" that's not actually available at full price. It's marketing theater.

**Premium Plus: $16.90/month**
- Unlimited messaging with 30 matches monthly
- See all photos on profiles
- Full personality profile
- State-level location
- See who viewed your profile

Still limited. 30 matches per month might work in a big city but fails in smaller markets. Still can't filter by distance tighter than state-level.

**Premium Unlimited: $18.90/month**
- Unlimited messaging with ALL matches (no monthly cap)
- See all photos
- Full personality profile
- State-level location
- See who viewed you
- Filter for new members first

This is the only viable tier, and even it has the stupid state-level location limit on the Basic plan.

### The Real Cost Hidden in Fine Print

Those prices are PER MONTH but require 6-24 month commitments paid upfront.

A 6-month plan costs $270-450 total ($45-75/month). A 12-month plan costs $420-660 total ($35-55/month). A 24-month plan costs $600-1080 total ($25-45/month).

You can sometimes break payments into 2-4 installments, but you're still responsible for the full amount if you cancel early. Cancel after two months? You still owe the remaining 10 months.

eHarmony also runs constant "sales" that aren't really sales. They email free trial members 40-60% off offers, but these typically apply only to the first installment or first few months, not the entire subscription. The fine print reveals the real cost.

Auto-renewal is default. If you don't manually cancel before your term ends, you're automatically charged for another full term at whatever the current non-promotional rate is. BBB complaints consistently mention unexpected $300-600 charges from auto-renewal.

Some states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, Wisconsin) have 3-day cancellation windows with full refunds due to consumer protection laws. Most states don't.

### Is Premium Worth It?

The free version is borderline worthless, so premium is mandatory if you actually want to use eHarmony. But whether it's worth $300-900 depends entirely on your financial situation and priorities.

**Worth it if:** You're genuinely marriage-minded, you've exhausted free apps with poor results, you value quality over quantity, and most importantly, the cost won't create financial stress. If dropping $500 on dating is like buying new tires (necessary expense, no big deal), then sure.

**Not worth it if:** The cost represents a financial sacrifice. If you're choosing between eHarmony and fixing your car, paying bills, or building emergency savings, do not buy eHarmony. No relationship is worth financial instability.

Also not worth it if you're not genuinely ready to commit to someone long-term. At $50+/month, this is an expensive way to casually date.

### How It Compares to Competition

Let's put eHarmony's cost in perspective:

- **Match.com:** $20-45/month for 6-12 month plans. Similar features but less sophisticated matching. Still expensive but more reasonable.
- **Hinge:** Free with $10-30/month optional premium. Much cheaper. Less serious user base but way more accessible.
- **Bumble:** Free with $10-40/month premium. Younger and more casual demographic. Free version actually works.
- **Coffee Meets Bagel:** Free with optional in-app purchases. Similar curation approach. Free tier is usable.
- **The League:** $99-999/month. More exclusive and selective. Smaller pool. Makes eHarmony look cheap.

eHarmony is definitively the most expensive mainstream dating app. Match comes close but still cheaper. Hinge and Bumble cost 60-80% less. You're paying a premium for the compatibility system and serious user base.

Whether that's worth it is personal. For someone making $80k+ who's spent years on free apps with no success, $600/year might be worth it. For someone making $35k with student loans, it's probably not realistic.

## How SwipeStats Actually Rates eHarmony

We tested eHarmony for several weeks across multiple accounts and locations. Here's our honest assessment.

**Overall Score: 3.5/5**

eHarmony delivers on its core promise of serious daters and sophisticated matching, but the high cost and restrictive free tier make it inaccessible for many people. It's genuinely the best option for marriage-minded singles with disposable income. It's a terrible option for everyone else.

### Attractiveness of Users: 4/5

User attractiveness is above average compared to free swipe apps, though not dramatically different from other paid platforms like Match.

The bigger difference is profile quality and effort. Users have detailed bios, answered prompts thoroughly, uploaded multiple clear photos, and clearly invested time. You see fewer half-assed profiles with three blurry selfies and no bio.

However, the "can't see clear photos without paying" issue means free users literally cannot assess attractiveness, which is frustrating. Physical attraction matters in relationships whether we admit it or not. eHarmony's approach of hiding photos behind a paywall feels manipulative.

During testing, I found the user base more "normal looking" than Instagram-filtered apps like Tinder. Less model-quality photos, more real humans. Whether that's good or bad depends on what you're looking for.

### User Base Quality: 4/5

The user base is unquestionably high-quality in terms of seriousness and intentions. People here genuinely want relationships. The high price and lengthy sign-up naturally filter for commitment.

During testing, 90%+ of matches explicitly stated they wanted serious relationships or marriage. Compare this to Hinge where maybe half the profiles claiming to want relationships actually mean it.

However, the pool is smaller than mainstream apps, especially outside major cities. In rural areas, you might get 2-3 matches per month, which isn't viable. The user base also skews 30-55, which is perfect for that demographic but limiting if you're younger or older.

Also notably less diverse than mainstream apps. The user base tends more conservative, more traditional, more white, more heteronormative. That's fine if it matches your demographic, but it's worth noting.

### Match Rate: 3/5

Match rate is hard to evaluate traditionally because you don't swipe - you receive curated matches based on compatibility.

During testing in a major metro area, I received 5-10 new matches per week. Compare this to 50+ potential matches daily on Hinge. The matches I got were legitimately better-aligned with my values and relationship goals, but the volume was frustrating when several didn't respond or weren't interested.

In a smaller market (mid-size city, 200k population), I received 2-3 matches per week. In a rural area test (small town, 20k population), I received 1-2 matches per month, which is basically non-functional.

The quality was consistently higher than swipe apps, but quantity matters too. You need enough matches to have options. If your first three 80%+ compatibility matches don't work out, waiting another month for more matches is brutal.

### Pricing: 2/5

The pricing is the biggest obstacle preventing eHarmony from being a top-tier recommendation.

At $300-900 for 6-12 months paid upfront, this is a significant investment that many great potential partners simply cannot afford or reasonably justify. While the high price does filter for serious users (true), it also filters out plenty of wonderful people who are marriage-minded but can't drop $500 on a dating app.

The near-useless free tier feels predatory. The frequent complaints about difficult cancellations and surprise auto-renewal charges hurt consumer trust. The misleading promotional pricing (50% off the first month only, not the entire subscription) feels scammy.

If eHarmony offered a genuine 1-month trial at $50-75 with full features, it would be much more reasonable. As it stands, you're committing hundreds of dollars sight unseen, which is a huge ask.

## Your Actual Questions Answered

### Is eHarmony worth it?

Yes, if you're genuinely marriage-minded, over 30, willing to invest $300-900 for 6-12 months, and you've had consistently poor experiences on free apps.

The compatibility matching does work better than swiping through faces. The user base is significantly more serious. You'll waste less time on people who aren't ready for commitment.

However, it's NOT worth it if you're casually dating, on a tight budget, under 25, want to try before committing financially, or live in a small market with limited matches.

For those situations, try [Hinge or Bumble](/blog/bumble-review) first. They're free, have larger user bases, and let you test the waters without dropping $500.

### Does eHarmony actually work?

According to their claims (2M+ marriages since founding) and independent research (University of Chicago and Harvard studies showing highest marriage rates and satisfaction among major platforms), yes, eHarmony works better than most dating platforms for long-term relationships.

During my testing, the high compatibility matches (80%+) had noticeably better conversation quality, more aligned values, and more serious intentions than lower percentage matches or matches from free apps.

That said, success depends entirely on your location, demographic, and profile quality. In small towns or for niche preferences, the limited match pool may make it ineffective regardless of algorithm sophistication. If you're one of 50 eHarmony users in your entire county, the algorithm can't magic compatible people into existence.

Also, "works" is relative. eHarmony increases your odds of finding a compatible long-term partner compared to random chance or swiping. It doesn't guarantee results. Dating is still dating.

### How much does eHarmony cost?

Pricing ranges from $15-75 per month depending on subscription length, tier, and promotional discounts.

The real costs: 6-month plans typically cost $270-450 total ($45-75/month). 12-month plans cost $420-660 total ($35-55/month). 24-month plans cost $600-1080 total ($25-45/month).

All plans must be paid upfront or broken into 2-4 installments. You're responsible for the full amount even if you cancel early.

The free version is essentially useless. You cannot see clear photos or send real messages without paying. There's no functional free trial.

eHarmony runs constant "sales" advertising 40-60% off, but these typically apply only to the first month or installment, not the entire subscription. Read the fine print carefully.

### Is eHarmony legit or a scam?

eHarmony is a legitimate dating platform that's been operating since 2000 (25+ years). It's not a scam in the sense that it's a real company providing an actual service.

However, there are legitimate complaints about aggressive auto-renewal, difficult cancellation processes, and the predatory nature of the paywall. The BBB gives them an A- rating despite numerous consumer complaints about billing.

You will encounter far fewer fake profiles and scammers than on free apps. The company's trust and safety protocols are strong. During testing, I encountered zero fake profiles or scam attempts.

The platform itself is real and delivers what it promises (sophisticated matching, serious user base). Whether the value justifies the cost is subjective.

### Why is eHarmony so damn expensive?

Several factors contribute to the high cost:

**Algorithm development and maintenance:** Building and maintaining a sophisticated matching system using 25+ years of relationship data requires significant technical investment.

**Manual review and safety:** eHarmony employs trust and safety teams to manually review profiles and photos, which costs more than automated systems.

**Intentional filtering strategy:** The high price deliberately filters for serious daters willing to invest. It's not just revenue, it's gatekeeping.

**Smaller user base:** With fewer users than free apps, eHarmony can't rely on advertising revenue as heavily. They need higher subscription prices to maintain operations.

**Premium market positioning:** eHarmony positions itself as the premium option for serious daters. Higher pricing reinforces this perception.

Whether the cost is justified depends on your priorities and financial situation. You're paying for quality over quantity and sophisticated matching over simple proximity. But it's still expensive as hell compared to alternatives.

### What do people complain about with eHarmony?

The most frequent complaints based on BBB reviews and consumer reports:

**Difficult cancellation and unexpected charges:** Many users report struggling to cancel subscriptions, reaching customer service, or getting charged for full annual amounts when canceling early. Auto-renewal catches people off guard.

**Charged full price after canceling:** When you cancel, you still owe the full contract amount. No prorated refunds. If you bought 12 months and quit after 2, you pay for all 12.

**Limited matches in smaller areas:** Outside major metros, match pools are tiny. Some users report 1-2 matches per month, which isn't enough to make the investment worthwhile.

**Inactive profiles shown as active:** Some complaints mention being shown profiles of people who haven't logged in for months, making it seem like there are more active users than actually exist.

**Can't do anything without paying:** The aggressive paywall that blocks photos and messaging frustrates users who want to try the app before committing hundreds of dollars.

**Matches too far away:** Basic plan only filters to state level, so someone 8 hours away might show up as a match, which is useless for most people.

**Customer service is hard to reach:** Multiple complaints mention difficulty contacting support when issues arise with billing or technical problems.

**Misleading promotional pricing:** The "50% off" promotions often apply only to the first month or installment, not the entire subscription, which feels deceptive.

### Can you actually use eHarmony for free?

Technically yes. Practically no.

The free version lets you: complete the personality questionnaire, create your profile, see matches (with blurred photos), send/receive "likes," and access dating advice articles.

You CANNOT: see clear photos, send or read messages, use video chat, filter matches by distance beyond state level, or see who viewed your profile.

The free tier is essentially a 45-minute marketing funnel designed to push you toward paid membership. You invest significant time completing the questionnaire and profile, then hit an immediate paywall preventing you from actually using the app.

Even the "free trial" doesn't give you access to key features. It just gets you past the questionnaire stage.

Compare this to Hinge or Bumble where the free versions are genuinely functional. You can message matches, see photos, and have real conversations without paying. eHarmony's free version is borderline deceptive in how limited it is.

### How long does the questionnaire actually take?

The compatibility questionnaire takes 30-45 minutes for most users.

Some people report finishing in 20 minutes by rushing through, but that defeats the purpose since thoughtful answers improve matching quality. Others report taking 60+ minutes by being very deliberate with responses.

The questionnaire includes 80+ questions covering personality traits, values, lifestyle, relationship goals, deal-breakers, and hypothetical scenarios. You also answer abstract preference questions choosing between shapes and images.

After the quiz, you spend additional time completing your profile: demographics, answering prompts, writing bio, uploading photos. This adds another 15-30 minutes.

Total initial time investment from download to finished profile: 45-75 minutes minimum. This is by far the longest sign-up process of any major dating app.

If you have limited attention span or hate surveys, you'll struggle. The process is deliberately lengthy to filter for serious users willing to invest effort.

### Does eHarmony have fake profiles?

eHarmony has significantly fewer fake profiles than free dating apps due to several factors:

**High cost barrier:** Scammers won't pay $500 to create fake profiles when free apps exist.

**SMS verification requirement:** You must verify your phone number during sign-up.

**Manual photo approval:** Photos go through human review before appearing on your profile.

**Active Trust and Safety team:** The company employs teams monitoring for suspicious behavior and removing fake accounts quickly.

During my testing across several weeks, I encountered zero obvious fake profiles or scam attempts. Compare this to POF or Tinder where you'll encounter bots and scammers constantly.

However, some reviewers report occasional scammers who slip through the system. No platform is 100% perfect.

There are also complaints about inactive profiles being shown as active matches. These aren't fake profiles - they're real people who signed up months or years ago but no longer use the app. The platform apparently shows them in match feeds anyway, which is frustrating when you send messages that never get responses.

### Can you cancel eHarmony anytime?

You can turn off auto-renewal anytime to prevent future charges. However, you're still responsible for the full subscription length you initially agreed to.

If you bought a 12-month plan for $540 and cancel after 2 months, you still owe the full $540. There are no prorated refunds. You're paying for the full term whether you use it or not.

Some states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, Wisconsin) have 3-day cancellation windows with full refunds due to consumer protection laws. Most states don't offer this protection.

To cancel: Log in → Your Profile → Data & Settings → Subscription → Cancel Auto-Renewal.

**Critical: DO NOT just delete the app.** Deleting the app does not cancel your subscription. You'll continue being charged. You must manually cancel through account settings.

Many BBB complaints mention difficulty reaching customer service to cancel or unexpected charges after thinking they canceled. Follow the cancellation process carefully and screenshot confirmation.

### What age group actually uses eHarmony?

While eHarmony technically allows users 18+, the core demographic is 30-55 years old. This is the most active and well-represented age range.

During testing, I saw very few profiles under 28. The 40-50 age group is particularly well-represented. The platform is also popular with divorced and widowed singles looking for second-chance relationships.

If you're under 25, you'll likely find better options on Hinge, Bumble, or Tinder where the user base skews younger. The eHarmony crowd is done with hookups and casual dating. They're looking to settle down.

If you're 60+, there are users, but the pool is smaller than dedicated senior dating sites. The sweet spot is definitely 30-55.

## The Bottom Line on eHarmony

<a href="https://tms.eharmony.com/cl?m315=c&q=o1dSHENv8YsxD7CzcHkn0jqQ" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank">eHarmony</a> works for what it promises: connecting marriage-minded singles using sophisticated compatibility matching. The user base is serious, the algorithm is backed by real data, and the success rates are higher than most platforms.

But it's expensive as hell, and that's a real barrier for many people who would otherwise benefit from the service.

If you're 30-55, genuinely ready to commit to a long-term relationship within 1-2 years, have $300-900 in disposable income, and have wasted enough time on free apps that you're ready to invest in something more serious, <a href="https://tms.eharmony.com/cl?m315=c&q=o1dSHENv8YsxD7CzcHkn0jqQ" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank">eHarmony is worth trying</a> for 6-12 months.

If you're younger, on a tight budget, not ready to commit to someone, or just want to explore online dating, skip eHarmony. Use Hinge or Bumble's free versions instead.

The ideal eHarmony user is someone who views the $500-900 annual cost the same way they view a gym membership or Netflix subscription - a reasonable ongoing expense for something that improves their life. If that cost represents a financial sacrifice, it's not worth it.

Dating apps are tools. eHarmony is an expensive power tool that works really well for specific applications. Most people need a basic hammer, not a $500 power drill.
