## How NOT to Answer the 'I Go Crazy For' Prompt (Unless You Want to Die Alone)

Before we dive into the good stuff, let's talk about the answers that'll make you look like a complete tool.

If you're using any of these, stop it. Seriously.

Here are five examples of answers that'll have your matches running for the hills:

- ... you (Congrats, you've just told everyone you're desperate and probably a stalker)
- ... sex (Great, you've reduced yourself to a hormonal teenager)
- ... money (Nothing says "I have a personality" like being a walking ATM)
- ... myself (Narcissism isn't as attractive as you think it is)
- ... pizza (Unless you're a Ninja Turtle, find a more interesting obsession)
  These answers are about as appealing as a root canal. They're lazy, they're boring, and they scream "I have the personality of a stale cracker." You're on a dating app, not writing your shopping list. Act like it.

## How I Would Personally Answer 'I Go Crazy For'

The key here is to be interesting without trying too hard. You want to show that you have a personality, but not that your entire personality is "trying to impress strangers on the internet." Remember, [Hinge](/blog/hinge-review) is all about creating a genuine connection, so let's make your profile stand out.

Here's how I'd do it:

- ... dolphins (I like dolphins, okay?)
- ... women who can deadlift more than their emotional baggage
- ... women who can explain quantum physics while doing a handstand. If you can't, explain yourself
- ... the sweet sound of my alarm not going off on a Saturday morning
- ... people who use their turn signals
- ... you, but only if you have any giraffe facts
- ... the sound of my neighbor practicing saxophone at 3 AM (just kidding, Brad, please stop)
- ... finding a parking spot right in front of where I'm going (it's like winning the lottery, but better)
- ... unexpected acts of kindness from strangers (restores my faith in humanity every time)
- ... the first sip of coffee in the morning (it's not addiction, it's appreciation)
- ... perfectly timed puns
- ... finding money in old coat pockets
- ... the smell of freshly cut grass (nature's way of saying "summer's here")
- ... the satisfaction of peeling a mandarin
  These answers show that you appreciate the simple pleasures in life and have a sense of humor. They're relatable without being cliché, and they give potential matches something to connect with.

Use them wisely, young one.

## Cheeky Answers (For Those Who Like to Live Dangerously)

Alright, listen up. If you're going to go the cheeky route, you better commit to it. Half-assed cheekiness is about as attractive as a hangover on a Monday morning. The goal here is to make them laugh, not roll their eyes so hard they see their own brain.

Here are 10 cheeky examples that might actually get you a date (no guarantees, though):

- ... people who understand that cilantro tastes like soap and support my trauma
- people who can keep up with my Netflix binge-watching pace (weak stamina need not apply)
- ... the sound of my crypto portfolio crashing... I'm into pain
- ... finding out a meeting could have been an email
- ... the person who invented stretchy pants (you're the real MVP)
- ... finally remembering why I walked into a room
- ... people who don't clap when the plane lands
- ... women who understand that a hot dog is technically a sandwich
- ... women who understand that cereal is technically soup (I will die on this hill)
- ... anyone who's ever tried to eat a banana in public without looking suspicious
- ... when autocorrect actually getting it right for once (it's a Christmas miracle)
  Remember, the key to pulling off cheeky answers is confidence. If you're going to be a smartass, own it.

Nothing's worse than someone who makes a joke and then immediately apologizes for it. You're not here to make friends; you're here to get dates. And if they can't handle your humor, they probably can't handle you.

## Funny Answers (Because Laughter is Better Than a Six-Pack... Sometimes)

Let's face it: being funny is hard. It's like trying to explain why you still use Internet Explorer – it's possible, but it's not going to be pretty. But here's the thing: a good sense of humor is like a good credit score. It can get you places you have no business being.

So here are 10 funny answers that might make your match laugh instead of immediately unmatching you:

- ... finding a typo in a menu
- ...the pure joy of canceling plans I never wanted to make
- ... successfully carrying all the groceries in one trip (who needs a gym membership?)
- ...women who appreciate dad jokes but won't admit it in public
- ...the thrill of successfully navigating our entire first date without revealing I've forgotten you're name
- ... finally understanding a meme without having to Google it (I'm hip, I'm with it)
- ... pretending I'm on a cooking show while making ramen
- ... using "whom" correctly in a sentence (I'm basically Shakespeare)
- ... finding the end of a tape roll on the first try (it's my superpower)
- ... accidentally liking a 3-year-old Instagram post. Wait no, I hate that
- ... winning an argument with my cat (it doesn't happen often)
- ... understanding what my plant wants when it starts drooping (I speak Ficus)
  Remember that funny is subjective. What makes one person laugh might make another person swipe left faster than you can say "It was just a joke!" But that's okay. You're not trying to be everyone's cup of tea. You're looking for the person who thinks your brand of weird is just right.

Remember, the goal here isn't to be a comedian. It's to show that you don't take yourself too seriously and that you can laugh at the absurdities of life (and dating). If they can't appreciate that, well, their loss. You'll be too busy laughing at your own jokes to notice anyway.

## Deeply Personal Answers (For Those Who Like to Show They Have a Soul)

Alright, we're about to enter the danger zone of online dating: getting personal. This is where most people fuck up royally. They either go too deep too fast and scare off potential matches, or they play it so safe they might as well be a beige wall in a doctor's office.

The trick is to be genuine without oversharing. You want to give a glimpse of your soul, not your entire psychological profile. Here are 10 examples that walk that fine line:

- ... that moment when you're laughing so hard with friends that you can't breathe
- ... the feeling of accomplishment after finishing a challenging book (mental gains are the best gains)
- ... watching the sunrise after pulling an all-nighter
- ... the first bite of a home-cooked meal after a long trip
- ... finding someone who shares my obscure interests
- ... that post-workout endorphin rush (who needs drugs when you have squats?)
- ... getting lost in a new city and discovering hidden gems
- ... the sound of my niece's laughter (it's like bottled happiness)
- ... mastering a new skill after weeks of practice (guitar, I will conquer you)
- ... those rare moments of perfect clarity when everything just makes sense
  These answers show that you're willing to be vulnerable, but in a way that's still relatable and engaging. You're not dumping your entire life story in their lap, but you're giving them enough to work with. It's like offering a sample at Costco – just enough to make them want more.

## The "I'm Actually Interesting" Answers (For Those Who Are... Well, Interesting)

Let's be real for a second. Most people on dating apps are about as interesting as watching paint dry. But you're not most people, right? You've got depth. You've got passions. You've got... well, something that sets you apart from the sea of "I like hiking and The Office" profiles out there.

Here are 10 answers that scream "I'm actually an interesting human being" without coming off as a pretentious asshole:

- ... exploring abandoned buildings
- ... trying to recreate dishes from my favorite movies (Ratatouille was a challenge)
- ... collecting vinyl records of obscure 80s bands (ask me about my Flock of Seagulls collection)
- ... perfecting my homemade hot sauce recipe (warning: may cause spontaneous dance parties)
- ... stargazing on clear nights and pondering our place in the universe (deep thoughts and mosquito bites included)
- ... learning random skills on YouTube at 2 AM (I'm now a semi-professional juggler)
- ... finding the perfect gif to respond to any situation (it's an art form, really)
- ... planning elaborate themed dinner parties (last month was "Post-Apocalyptic Picnic")
- ... trying to beat my personal record in the local escape room (current time to beat: 37 minutes.
- ... conducting blind taste tests of different coffee beans (I'm basically a caffeine sommelier)
  These answers show that you've got interests beyond Netflix and chill. They paint a picture of someone who's willing to try new things, who has a sense of adventure, and who might actually be fun to hang out with.

## The Art of Balance: Humor, Personality, and Authenticity

Now, let's talk about the secret sauce that'll make your Hinge profile irresistible: balance. You want to strike the perfect chord between humor and sincerity, showcasing your personality without coming off as a try-hard or a one-dimensional joke machine.

Remember, dating apps like Hinge are tools in modern dating, but they're not the whole toolbox. Your profile should be a teaser trailer for the blockbuster that is you. Here's how to nail it:

1. **Mix it up**: Don't make every answer a joke. Sprinkle in some humor, add a dash of personal stories, and top it off with a hint of your life goals.
2. **Be authentic**: As tempting as it is to create a "perfect" profile, authenticity wins every time. Show your genuine personality traits. If you're a bit of a geek who goes crazy for Mario Kart tournaments, own it!
3. **Show, don't tell**: Instead of saying "I'm funny," demonstrate your sense of humor through your answers. Same goes for any other quality you want to highlight.
4. **Keep it fresh**: Update your answers occasionally. It keeps your profile interesting for repeat viewers and shows you're actively engaged.
5. **Use visuals**: If Hinge allows, add photos that complement your answers. Going crazy for travel? Add a picture from your latest adventure.
6. **Be specific**: "I go crazy for dogs" is okay, but "I go crazy for teaching my corgi new tricks" is better. It gives potential matches more to work with.
7. **Mind the length**: Aim for answers that are long enough to be interesting but short enough to leave them wanting more.
8. **Proofread**: Nothing kills the vibe faster than typos or grammatical errors. Give your profile a once-over before setting it live.
   Remember, dating coach extraordinaire Logan Ury says that your profile should be a conversation starter. Each answer should give potential matches something to ask about or comment on.
