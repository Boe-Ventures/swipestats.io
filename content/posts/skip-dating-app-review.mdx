## How Does Skip Work?

Skip is a video chat dating app that's trying to mix up the dating game by bringing speed dating to your smartphone. It's like Tinder and Zoom had a baby, but this kid's pretty intriguing.

We're all short on time and patience, Skip aims to cut through the noise and get you face-to-face with potential matches quickly.

### How is Skip different from other dating apps?

Unlike traditional swipe-based apps like [Tinder](/blog/tinder-review), Skip throws you straight into 3-minute video chats with potential matches.

No more endless texting or profile stalking – you're face-to-face (virtually) within minutes. It's made to cut through the crap and get you connecting with people, fast.

This definitely has some benefits. First, it fixes the issue of matches who are great at texting but have zero real-life chemistry.

Second, it saves you time – no more talking for weeks to find out you're not compatible when you meet.

Lastly, it basically destroys the chances of catfishing, because, well, it's pretty hard to fake who you are on a live video call.

### Skip's user base

As of 2026, Skip's user base is still budding. It's attracting millennials and Gen Z singles who are fed up with the superficiality of other apps. These are people who value authenticity and are willing to step out of their comfort zone for a chance at a genuine connection.

The gender ratio on Skip is fairly balanced, which is a refreshing change from some apps where one gender heavily outnumbers the other. However, it's important to note that the total number of users is still relatively small compared to giants like Tinder or [Bumble](/blog/bumble-review).

This means that while your chances of finding a quality match might be higher, you might run out of options more quickly, especially if you're not in a major metropolitan area.

## Pros & Cons of Skip

### Pros:

- Genuine connections: The video chat format fosters authentic interactions. You see facial expressions, hear the tone of voice, and get a real sense of someone's personality right off the bat.
- Time-saving: No more weeks of messaging before meeting. You can gauge compatibility in minutes.
- Reduced catfishing: It's hard to fake who you are on a video call. What you see is (mostly) what you get.
- Icebreaker prompts: The app provides conversation starters, which help eliminate awkward silences and keep the conversation flowing.
- Safety features: Easy reporting and blocking for creeps. The video format also adds an extra layer of safety compared to meeting strangers in person.
- Innovative approach: Skip is trying something new in a market that's often stagnant. Even if it's not perfect, it's refreshing to see innovation.

### Cons:

- Small user base: Fewer potential matches compared to larger apps. This can be particularly frustrating if you live in a less populated area.
- Technical issues: Video calls can be glitchy at times, which can ruin the flow of a conversation.
- Potential for awkwardness: Not everyone is comfortable on camera, especially with strangers. This can lead to some cringe-worthy moments.
- Limited free tier: While you can use the app for free, the limitations might push you towards paying sooner than you'd like.

## Who Is Skip For?

### Skip is for you if:

- You want to cut to the chase. If you value your time and hate the idea of drawn-out texting phases before meeting, Skip could be your new best friend.
- You value genuine connections over superficial matches. The video format allows for more authentic interactions from the get-go.
- You're comfortable expressing yourself on video. If you're the type who shines in face-to-face interactions, you'll likely do well on Skip.
- You're looking for efficiency in your dating experience. Skip allows you to "meet" multiple potential matches in a single evening without leaving your couch.
- You're frustrated with catfishing or misrepresentation on other dating apps. The video format makes it much harder for people to hide behind old photos or fake personas.

### It's not for you if:

- You prefer taking things slow and building and carefully crafting your messages, taking time to think before responding. The immediacy of video calls might be stressful.
- You're camera-shy or have anxiety about video calls. While Skip might be a good way to practice these skills, it could be overwhelming if you're not ready.
- You live in a less populated area. The dating pool might be too small to provide enough matches, leading to frustration.
- You enjoy the process of swiping and the dopamine hit it provides. Skip removes this gamified element, which some users might miss. — If this is you, check out [GetDatesAI](https://getdates.ai) which helps you get more dates on apps like tinder by giving you professional level photos at a fraction of the cast so people won't be able to resist swiping right on your profile.
- You're looking for casual hookups. While not impossible, the format of Skip tends to attract people looking for more serious connections.

## Key Features of Skip

### Video Speed Dates

The heart and soul of Skip is its 3-minute video dates with people. It's like speed dating on steroids, letting you quickly gauge chemistry and compatibility.

This feature is unique to Skip and sets it apart from text-based apps. The time limit keeps things moving and prevents conversations from dragging on if there's no spark.

### Match Recommendations

Skip uses AI to suggest compatible matches based on your preferences and behavior. While not groundbreaking, it does seem to do a decent job of presenting relevant options.

The more you use the app, the better it gets at understanding your type.

### Location-Based Matching

Skip does utilize location-based settings to enhance your dating experience. Here's how it works:

- Proximity matching: Skip uses your device's GPS to match you with users in your area. This ensures you're connecting with people you could potentially meet in person.
- Adjustable radius: You can set your preferred search radius, allowing you to expand or narrow your pool of potential matches based on how far you're willing to travel for a date.
- City-based searching: If you're planning a trip or considering a move, Skip allows you to change your location to explore dating options in different cities.
- Local events: In some major cities, Skip organizes meetups and events in person for users, leveraging the app's location data to bring matches together in real life.
  It's worth noting that while these location features are helpful, they're also dependent on the size of Skip's user base in your area. In larger cities, you'll likely have more options, while smaller towns might have a limited pool of potential matches.

### Icebreaker Prompts

During video calls, Skip provides conversation starters to keep things flowing. It's a godsend for those awkward moments when you're not sure what to say next.

These prompt questions are often quirky and fun, designed to reveal personality traits and common interests quickly.

### Topic Clusters

Skip groups users into "Topic Clusters" based on shared interests. It's a neat way to find people who are into the same weird shit you are. Whether you're a die-hard Star Wars fan or a passionate rock climber, this feature helps you connect with like-minded individuals.

### Deal Breaker Screener

This feature allows you to make custom deal breaker questions. It lets you set hard limits on what you're looking for. Deal breaker screener questions are great for filtering out incompatible matches before you waste time on a call.

Whether it's smoking, political views, or desire for kids, you can make sure you're only matched with people who align with your non-negotiables.

### Post-Date Feedback

After each video date, you can provide actual date feedback on the experience. This helps improve the matching algorithm and allows you to reflect on what you're looking for in a partner.

### Profile Badges

Users can earn badges for various achievements on the app, like completing a certain number of video dates or receiving positive feedback. It's a fun way to gamify the experience and showcase your dating prowess.

## Sign-Up Process & Creating a Dating Profile

1. Download the app and verify your phone number.
2. Upload a profile picture and fill in basic info (age, gender, location).
3. Answer a series of prompt questions to showcase your personality. These are designed to bring out your unique traits and interests.
4. Set your preferences and deal breakers. Be honest here – it'll save you time in the long run.
5. Complete a short video intro (optional but recommended). This gives potential matches a sense of your personality and can help you stand out.
6. Grant necessary permissions for video and audio.
7. Take a quick tutorial on how to use the app's features.
   The process is straightforward and takes about 10-15 minutes if you put some thought into your answers. It's worth taking the time to craft a compelling dating profile – remember, you're competing for attention in a sea of faces.

## Skip Costs

Skip operates on a freemium model with fun features, which is pretty standard for dating apps these days. Here's the breakdown:

### Free Tier:

- Limited to 5 video dates per week
- Basic matching algorithm
- Ability to set basic preferences

### Skip Premium: $19.99/month or $99.99/year

- Unlimited video dates
- Advanced filtering options
- See who's viewed your dating profile
- Rewind feature to revisit passed matches
- Priority in the matching queue
- Ad-free experience
  Is Premium worth it? Well, that depends. If you're in a populated area and serious about finding the perfect match, the unlimited dates could be worth the investment. The advanced features and filters can also save you time by ensuring you're only matched with people who meet your criteria.

However, given the current size of the user base, you might not need it unless you're in a major city. The free tier is actually quite generous compared to some other apps, allowing you to get a good feel for the platform before committing.

One thing to consider is that if you're using the app frequently, the cost per date is actually quite low compared to traditional dating. No more spending $50 on drinks with someone you know isn't right within the first 5 minutes.

## How Swipestats Rates Skip

Overall verdict: 3.5/5 - Skip shows promise with its innovative approach, but it's held back by its limited user base and occasional technical hiccups. It's a solid concept that could really take off if it gains more traction.

### Attractiveness of the users: 3.5/5

The quality of potential perfect matches on Skip is generally good. The video-first approach tends to attract people who have more serious dating goals, which often correlate with taking care of their appearance. You're less likely to encounter the "bathroom mirror selfie" crowd here.

That said, because the user base is smaller, you might not find the same variety you would on larger dating sites. It's quality over quantity, which can be a good or bad thing depending on your perspective.

### User base: 2.5/5

This is where Skip struggles. While the concept is solid, the app simply doesn't have the numbers yet to compete with the big players. You might find yourself running out of options quickly, especially in smaller cities.

However, the users who are on Skip tend to be more engaged and serious about finding connections. So while the quantity might be lacking, the quality of interactions is often higher.

### Match rate: 4/5

When you do get matches, the success rate is quite high. The video format allows for a quick assessment of compatibility, leading to more meaningful connections. It's quality over quantity here.

The match rate is also helped by the fact that people who agree to a video call are generally more interested and less likely to ghost. You're not dealing with people who are just on the app for an ego boost or casual chitchat.

### Pricing: 3.5/5

The pricing is in line with other premium dating apps. However, given the smaller user base, it might feel a bit steep for some users. The free tier is decent enough to get a feel for the app before committing.

One positive is that the yearly subscription offers significant savings, which could be worth it if you find yourself using the app frequently.
