<TLDR>

### TL;DR🤷‍♂️

As someone who's been around the block (and swiped through more profiles than I care to admit), I've put Facebook Dating through its paces to see if it's worth your precious time and emotional energy.

- **Facebook Dating **is a feature within the main Facebook app that leverages your social network to find potential matches.
- **We give Facebook Dating 3.5 out of 5** - It's decent and free, with some unique features, but not groundbreaking enough to dethrone the dating service giants.
- **Who it's for:** Facebook users, especially those from Southeast Asia, looking to date within their extended social circles and those tired of the superficiality of swipe-based apps.
- **Biggest pros:** Free to use, large potential user base, integrated with Facebook events and groups, focused on fostering meaningful connections.
- **Biggest cons:** Limited to Facebook users, potential privacy concerns, less popular than standalone online dating apps, somewhat clunky user interface.
- **Photos matter: **Like with any other dating app, your photos are what get you matches on Facebook Dating. If you need an upgrade, check out [GetDates AI Dating Photos](https://getdates.ai/)
  </TLDR>

## Description of Facebook Dating

Facebook Dating is like that persistent friend who's always trying to set you up, but less annoying and more algorithm-driven. Launched in 2019, it's a dating feature nestled within the main Facebook app, aiming to create meaningful connections through shared interests, events, and mutual friends.

Think of it as Facebook's way of saying, "Hey, we already know everything about you, so why not let us find you a partner?"

It's a bold move in a world where many people are trying to decrease their Facebook usage, not integrate it further into their love lives.

### How is Facebook Dating different from other dating apps?

Unlike Tinder, Bumble, and [Hinge](https://www.swipestats.io/blog/hinge-review), Facebook Dating taps into your existing social network. It's like going to a party where everyone is a friend of a friend - there's a built-in sense of connection and safety.

The app suggests dozens of matches based on your Facebook activity, groups you're in, and events you've attended or expressed interest in.

This approach aims to connect you with people who share your interests and social circles, potentially leading to more compatible matches.

It's less about swiping on hot strangers and more about finding someone you might actually have something in common with.

### User base

The Facebook Dating user base is as diverse as Facebook itself - which is to say, it's massive and varied. You'll find everyone from college students to divorcees giving it a shot.

However, it tends to skew slightly older than apps like Tinder, with many users in their late 20s to early 40s.

In my experience, the user base seems to be more relationship-oriented than on some other apps.

You're less likely to find people looking for quick hookups (though they certainly exist) and more likely to encounter folks genuinely interested in finding a connection.

## Pros & Cons of Facebook Dating

Learn the the good, the bad, and the ugly of Facebook Dating:

**Pros:**

- Completely free to use (no premium features to tempt you or limit your experience)
- Enormous potential user base (hello, 2.8 billion Facebook users)
- Integration with Facebook events and groups for more natural, interest-based connections
- "Secret Crush" feature lets you safely express interest in Facebook friends without the awkwardness
- Detailed profiles with lots of basic details to work with, thanks to Facebook's data
- Focus on fostering meaningful connections rather than quick swipes
- Built-in safety features like sharing your live location during dates
  **Cons:**

- Limited to Facebook users (sorry, social media rebels and privacy enthusiasts)
- Potential privacy concerns (it's Facebook, after all - your dating life is now tied to your social media presence)
- Less popular than standalone dating apps, resulting in fewer active users in some areas
- User interface can feel clunky and less intuitive than dedicated dating apps
- Matches are sometimes geographically distant, even with location settings adjusted
- No desktop version - it's mobile-only, which can be limiting for some users

## Who Is Facebook Dating For?

Let's get real about who's going to love Facebook Dating and who's going to run screaming in the opposite direction.

### Facebook Dating is for you if:

- You're already a regular Facebook user and don't mind blending your social media and dating lives
- You want to date within your extended social network
- You're looking for more than just hookups and value meaningful connections
- You're tired of paying for dating apps and want a free alternative
- You enjoy the idea of connecting with people through shared interests and events
- You're in your late 20s to early 40s and find other apps too youth-oriented

### It's not for you if:

- You're not on Facebook or you're trying to reduce your Facebook usage
- You prefer the anonymity and separation of standalone dating apps
- You're looking for a huge, hyper-active user base like Tinder's
- You want advanced match algorithms or detailed personality tests
- Privacy is a major concern for you (remember, this is Facebook we're talking about)
- You're looking for lots of bells and whistles or a super slick user interface

## Key Features of Facebook Dating

Let's dive into what makes Facebook Dating unique in the crowded world of dating apps.

### Integration with Facebook Groups and Events

One of Facebook Dating's standout features is its integration with Facebook Groups and Events.

This allows you to connect with people who share your interests or attend the same events, making finding common ground and potential conversation starters easier.

For example, if you're both interested in the same local hiking group or have RSVP'd to the same concert, Facebook Dating will let you know. It's like having a built-in icebreaker that increases the chances of finding someone with similar interests.

### Secret Crush

The Secret Crush feature is Facebook Dating's answer to the age-old question: "What if my crush likes me back?" It lets you select up to nine Facebook friends or Instagram followers you're interested in.

If they're on Facebook Dating and add you to their Secret Crush list too, it's a perfect match made in social media heaven. It's like passing notes in high school, but with less risk of embarrassment.

This feature adds a fun, slightly nostalgic element to the app and can be a great way to finally make a move on that friend you've always had a thing for.

### Safety Features

It includes several robust safety features, showing that they've put some serious thought into user wellbeing:

- Share your live location with a trusted friend during a date
- Easily block and report users
- Control who sees your dating profile (it's separate from your main Facebook profile)
- Choose whether you want friends of friends to be potential matches
  While not unique to Facebook Dating, these features are well-implemented and easily accessible, which is crucial in the sometimes murky world of online dating.

### Virtual Dates

In response to the pandemic, Facebook Dating introduced virtual dating features. This allows you to have video calls within the app, making it easier to connect safely before meeting in person.

It's a nice touch that shows Facebook's ability to adapt to changing dating landscapes.

The virtual date feature is seamlessly integrated and can be a great way to ease into a first date, especially if you're nervous or want to vet your match a bit more before meeting in person.

### Second Look

The Second Look feature allows you to revisit profiles you've previously passed on. We all know that sometimes we're too quick to judge, and this feature gives you a chance to reconsider potential matches.

It's a small but meaningful addition that acknowledges the sometimes hasty nature of online dating decisions.

## Sign-Up Process & Creating a Profile

Setting up your Facebook Dating profile is straightforward, but it does require some thought to make it stand out. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Open the Facebook app and tap the menu icon (the three horizontal lines).
2. Scroll down and tap "Dating." If you don't see this option, it might not be available in your region yet.
3. Follow the prompts to set up your dating profile.
4. Choose your gender and the gender(s) you're interested in. Facebook Dating offers inclusive options here, which is great to see.
5. Select photos for your dating profile. These are separate from your main Facebook profile, giving you control over your dating image.
6. Answer questions about your personality and interests. Be honest and specific here - it's your chance to show your unique personality.
7. Set your location and distance preferences.
8. Choose whether you want to match with friends of friends or keep them separate.
9. Review and confirm your profile.
   The whole process takes about 10-15 minutes if you're thoughtful about your answers. Remember, the more effort you put into your profile, the better your chances of making meaningful connections.

## Facebook Dating Costs

Here's the best part about Facebook Dating: it's completely free. There are no premium features, no subscription tiers, and no hidden costs. In a world where dating apps are constantly trying to upsell you on "gold" memberships or "boost" features, this is refreshingly straightforward.

Is it worth it? Well, considering it costs nothing but your time (and maybe a little bit of your privacy), it's certainly worth giving it a shot if you're already on Facebook.

The lack of a paid tier means everyone is on an even playing field, which can be a nice change of pace from apps where paying users get significant advantages.

However, the flip side of this is that you don't get some of the perks that paid dating apps offer, like seeing who's liked you or having advanced filtering options.

## How Swipestats Rates Facebook Dating

Overall verdict: Facebook Dating earns a solid 3.5/5. It's a decent option with some unique features, but it's not revolutionizing the dating app scene. Here's our breakdown:

### Attractiveness of the matches: 3/5

The attractiveness of potential matches on Facebook Dating is about average compared to other dating apps. You'll find a mix of people, just like you would on Facebook itself. It's not a model-fest like some apps, but it's not a wasteland either.

In my experience, the range of attractiveness is wider than on some other apps, which can be a good thing.

It feels more like meeting people in the real world, where not everyone looks like they just stepped off a magazine cover.

### User base: 4/5

The user base is potentially huge, given Facebook's massive reach. However, active users on the dating feature seem to be fewer than on dedicated dating apps.

You might find more matches in urban areas, but rural users might struggle to find local connections.

That said, the quality of the user base is generally high. People tend to have more complete profiles and seem more invested in actually meeting and connecting, rather than just collecting dozens of matches.

### Match rate: 3.5/5

From personal experience, the match rate on Facebook Dating is decent, but not outstanding, because of its match algorithm. It's easier to match with people you have mutual friends or interests with, which can lead to more meaningful connections.

However, don't expect the rapid-fire matching you might get on Tinder.

The upside is that when you do match, there's often more substance to work with. You're more likely to have a real conversation rather than a string of "hey" messages that go nowhere.

### Pricing: 5/5

Facebook Dating gets top marks for pricing – it's totally free. No need to worry about subscription costs or premium features.

This makes it an excellent option for budget-conscious daters or those who want to dip their toes into online dating without financial commitment.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Facebook Dating

### Is Facebook Dating good?

Facebook Dating can be a good option, especially if you're already a regular Facebook user. It's free, integrated with your existing social network, and has some unique features.

However, its success largely depends on how active it is in your area and whether you're comfortable mixing your social media life with your dating life.

In my dating experience, it's particularly good for people who are looking for more meaningful connections and are tired of the superficiality of some other dating apps. If you're patient and put effort into your profile, you can find quality matches.

### How do I activate Facebook Dating?

To activate Facebook Dating, open the Facebook app, tap the menu icon, scroll down, and tap "Dating." Follow the prompts to set up your profile.

If you don't see the Dating option, it might not be available in your region yet, or you might need to update your Facebook app.

### Can my Facebook friends see if I'm on Facebook Dating?

No, your Facebook friends won't know you're using Facebook Dating unless you choose to tell them. Your Dating profile is separate from your main Facebook profile, and you can control who sees what.

However, remember that if you use the Secret Crush feature, those friends might find out you're on the app.

### Does Facebook Dating show your friends?

Facebook Dating doesn't show your Facebook friends as potential matches by default. However, if you use the Secret Crush feature, you can express interest in Facebook friends or Instagram followers.

You can also choose to see friends of friends as potential matches if you want to expand your dating pool.

### Is Facebook Dating better than Tinder?

This depends on what you're looking for. Facebook Dating is better for finding connections through shared interests and social circles, while Tinder offers a larger, more active user base and a more casual dating atmosphere.

Facebook Dating tends to be better for those looking for more serious relationships, while Tinder is often seen as more of a hookup app (though plenty of people find relationships there too).

For a detailed comparison, check out our [Tinder review](https://www.swipestats.io/blog/tinder-review).

### How does Facebook Dating compare to other dating apps?

Facebook Dating offers a unique approach by leveraging your existing social network. It's free and integrated with Facebook events and groups, which can lead to more organic connections.

However, it generally has fewer active users than popular standalone apps like Bumble and Tinder.

Compared to Bumble, Facebook Dating doesn't have the "women message first" feature, which some users might miss. It also lacks the detailed personality-based matching of apps like OkCupid.

However, its integration with Facebook's ecosystem is unparalleled. For more comparisons, take a look at our [review of Bumble](https://www.swipestats.io/blog/bumble-review) and other popular dating apps.

### Can you tell if someone is active on Facebook Dating?

Facebook Dating doesn't show when a user was last active or if they're currently online. This can be frustrating if you're trying to gauge someone's interest or responsiveness.

However, it also adds a level of privacy that some users appreciate.

### Does Facebook Dating tell if you screenshot?

No, Facebook Dating does not notify users if you take a screenshot of their profile or your conversations. However, it's always best to respect people's privacy and not share their information without consent.

### Can you search for someone specific on Facebook Dating?

Facebook Dating doesn't have a search function to find specific users. The app is designed to show you potential matches based on your preferences and activity. If you're looking to connect with a specific person, the Secret Crush feature is your best bet.

### Are there fake profiles on Facebook Dating?

While fake profiles can exist on any dating platform, Facebook Dating tends to have fewer compared to some other apps. This is because:

1. It's linked to your Facebook account, making it harder to create fake profiles.
2. Facebook uses algorithms to detect and remove fake accounts.
3. The focus on connecting through mutual friends and interests deters many scammers.
   However, always be cautious and report any suspicious activity. If a profile seems too good to be true or quickly asks to move off-platform, be wary. Trust your instincts and prioritize your safety when meeting new people online.
