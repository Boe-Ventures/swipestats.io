</TLDR>

## So What is CMB All About?

Coffee Meets Bagel isn't just another face in the crowded dating app space. It's the app equivalent of that friend who insists on setting you up but actually knows what they're doing.

Instead of throwing you into a sea of faces to swipe through mindlessly, Coffee Meets Bagel serves up a carefully selected batch of potential matches (affectionately called "Bagels") each day at noon.

### How is Coffee Meets Bagel different from other dating apps?

While apps like [Tinder](https://www.swipestats.io/blog/tinder-review) plays a numbers game, Coffee Meets Bagel is more like a boutique matchmaking service. Here's the deal:

1. **Limited daily matches:** Instead of endless swiping, you get a handful of curated compatible matches each day. It's quality over quantity, folks.
2. **Learning algorithm:** The app uses AI to learn your preferences over time. The more you use it, the better it gets at matching you with like-minded people you might actually like.
3. **Detailed profiles:** Coffee Meets Bagel encourages users to create more comprehensive profiles. You're not just judging based on a couple of selfies and a witty one-liner.
4. **Conversation starters:** The app provides icebreakers to help kick off conversations. No more staring at your screen trying to think of something more creative than "Hey."
5. **Time-limited matches:** Matches expire after 7 days. This creates a sense of urgency and encourages users to actually make a move instead of collecting matches like Pokémon cards.

### Who's on Coffee Meets Bagel?

If you're hoping to find a bunch of 20-somethings looking for a quick hookup, you're barking up the wrong tree here. Coffee Meets Bagel tends to attract:

- Young professionals in their late 20s to early 30s
- Individuals looking for serious relationships with like-minded people rather than casual relationships and flings
- Users who are tired of the superficiality of swipe-heavy apps
- Individuals who prefer quality interactions over quantity of matches
  The gender ratio on Coffee Meets Bagel is surprisingly balanced compared to many other popular dating apps. This means guys aren't competing with a bazillion other dudes for every woman's attention, which is a refreshing change of pace.

## Pros & Cons of Coffee Meets Bagel

Let's break it down, shall we?

### Pros:

1. **Quality-focused matching:** The app's AI learns your preferences over time, potentially leading to a better list of matches. It's like having a friend who actually remembers what you like in a partner.
2. **Limited daily matches:** This reduces dating fatigue and encourages more thoughtful interactions. No more mindless swiping while you're on the toilet (don't pretend you don't do it).
3. **Icebreaker prompts:** These make starting conversations easier, especially for those of us who break out in hives at the thought of small talk.
4. **Balanced gender ratio:** Unlike many dating apps where it feels like a sausage fest, Coffee Meets Bagel maintains a fairly even split between men and women.
5. **Detailed profiles:** The app encourages users to showcase their personality, not just their best duck face selfie.
6. **Photo Lab feature:** Get feedback on your profile pics from other users. It's like having a focus group for your dating profile.

### Cons:

1. **Limited matches:** If you're used to the endless buffet of Tinder, the daily limit might feel like being on a diet.
2. **Smaller user base:** Fewer users compared to mainstream apps. In smaller cities, you might run out of matches faster than you can say "grande latte."
3. **Time-sensitive:** List of matches expires after 7 days, which can be frustrating if you're not checking the app regularly. It's not great for those "I'll respond when I feel like it" types.
4. **Potentially slow process:** If you're looking for instant gratification, this might feel like watching paint dry.
5. **Can get expensive:** While the basic features are free, the premium features can add up if you're not careful.

## Who Is Coffee Meets Bagel For?

### Coffee Meets Bagel is for you if:

- You're tired of mindless swiping and want more meaningful connections.
- You prefer quality over quantity in your matches.
- You're looking for a relationship and go on real dates rather than casual dating or hookups.
- You're a busy professional who doesn't have time to waste on endless swiping.
- You appreciate a more thoughtful, curated approach to online dating.
- You're willing to be patient in your search for a meaningful connection.

### It's not for you if:

- You enjoy the thrill of swiping through hundreds of profiles.
- You're looking for immediate hookups or casual encounters.
- You prefer having a large pool of potential matches to choose from.
- You're not patient enough to wait for daily matches.
- You live in a smaller city or town where the user base might be limited.
- You're not willing to put effort into creating a detailed profile.

## Key Features of Coffee Meets Bagel

Let's dive into what makes this app tick:

### Daily Curated Matches

Every day at noon, you'll receive a batch of matches curated by the app's algorithm. It's like getting a fresh batch of bagels delivered to your door, except these bagels might lead to love (or at least a decent conversation).

Why it's good: This feature encourages you to take your time and consider each match carefully, rather than treating dating like you're picking produce at the supermarket.

Why it might suck: If you're used to having endless options, this limited approach might feel restrictive.

### Icebreakers

Coffee Meets Bagel provides prompts to help kick-start conversations. It's a godsend for those of us who break out in a cold sweat at the thought of coming up with a clever opening line.

Why it's good: It takes the pressure off and can lead to more meaningful initial conversations.

Why it might suck: If you're a smooth talker, you might find these prompts limiting or cheesy.

### Detailed Profiles

Unlike some apps where a single photo and a witty one-liner are all you get, Coffee Meets Bagel encourages users to create more detailed profiles. You can showcase your personality through prompts, detailed About Me sections, and multiple photos.

Why it's good: It gives you a better sense of who someone is before you decide to match.

Why it might suck: Creating a detailed profile takes time and effort. If you're lazy, this isn't the app for you.

### Beans App Currency

The app uses a virtual premium currency called "Beans" which can be used to unlock various features. It's a unique approach that gamifies the dating experience.

Why it's good: It adds an element of fun and strategy to using the app.

Why it might suck: It can lead to spending on app purchases more than you intended if you're not careful.

### Photo Lab

This feature allows you to get feedback on your profile photos from other users. It's a great way to figure out which pics are working for you and which ones are... well, not so much.

Why it's good: It can help you optimize your profile and increase your chances of getting quality matches.

Why it might suck: Subjecting yourself to the judgment of strangers can be a bit nerve-wracking.

### Discover Section

In addition to your daily bagels, you can browse through additional profiles in the Discover section. It's like the app's version of a bakery display case.

Why it's good: It gives you more options if you're not feeling your daily matches.

Why it might suck: It can be a bit overwhelming and goes against the app's core concept of limited, curated matches.

## Sign-Up Process & Creating a Profile

Alright, let's walk through how to get started on Coffee Meets Bagel. It's not rocket science, but there are a few steps:

1. Download the app and sign up using your phone number or Facebook account.
2. Verify your account via SMS or email. (Yes, you actually have to prove you're a real person.)
3. Fill out basic information like age, height, ethnicity, and religion. Be honest – your future bagel deserves to know if you're actually 5'8" and not 6'2".
4. Add photos – the app recommends at least 3. Choose wisely; this isn't the place for your fish pics or bathroom selfies.
5. Complete prompts to showcase your personality. This is your chance to shine, so put some thought into it.
6. Set your preferences for potential matches. Be realistic, but don't sell yourself short either.
7. Start receiving your daily bagels!
   The whole process takes about 10-15 minutes if you're actually putting effort into it. And trust me, you should. A half-assed profile leads to half-assed matches.

## Coffee Meets Bagel Costs

Coffee Meets Bagel operates on a freemium model. The basic features are free, but if you want to supercharge your experience with extra features, you'll need to shell out some cash.

**Free Version:**

- Receive and view a limited number of curated matches daily
- Send messages to mutual matches
- Use basic search filters
  **Premium Membership:**

- $35 per month
- $75 for 3 months ($25/month)
- $180 for 12 months ($15/month)
  Premium features include:

- Activity reports on your matches (see who's active and who's ghosting)
- Read receipts for messages (know when you're being ignored)
- 8 additional Discover Likes per month (for when your daily bagels aren't cutting it)
- Unlimited skip-the-line feature (get seen by more potential matches)
  Is it worth it? If you have serious relationship goals and have the budget to achieve them, the special features from the premium plan can definitely give you an edge.

But the free version is still perfectly usable if you're patient and don't mind a slower process.

Remember, throwing money at an online dating app doesn't guarantee success. It's like buying expensive running shoes – they might help, but you still need to do the work.

## How Swipestats Rates Coffee Meets Bagel

**Overall Score: 4/5**

Coffee Meets Bagel offers a refreshing approach to online dating, focusing on quality over quantity. While it may not be for everyone, it's a solid choice for those seeking meaningful connections.

### Attractiveness of the matches: 4/5

The quality-over-quantity approach seems to work here. While you won't see as many profiles as on other apps, the ones you do see tend to be high-quality matches.

It's like the difference between a fancy cocktail bar and a crowded nightclub – fewer options, but generally better quality.

### User base: 3.5/5

The user base is smaller compared to giants like Tinder or Bumble, but it's growing. In major cities, you'll find a decent number of potential matches, but in smaller towns, pickings might be slim.

It's like trying to find a good bagel shop in a small town – possible, but you might have to lower your expectations.

### Match rate: 4/5

Thanks to the curated matching system, the match rate tends to be higher than on swipe-heavy apps. However, the limited number of daily matches means you might not get as many matches overall. It's quality over quantity, remember?

### Pricing: 3.5/5

The premium features are useful, but the price point is a bit steep compared to other dating apps. However, if you're serious about finding a relationship, it could be worth the investment.

Think of it as the difference between buying cheap coffee from a vending machine and splurging on a nice cappuccino – sometimes, you get what you pay for.

Their limited daily matches system also makes the platform less attractive to scammers. However, some fake profiles can still slip through.

Watch out for profiles that seem too good to be true, have limited information, or quickly ask to move conversations off the app.

Coffee Meets Bagel is available in many countries, but its user base is largest in the United States, Canada, and select Asian countries like Singapore and Hong Kong. If you're outside these areas, you might find the user base to be limited.
