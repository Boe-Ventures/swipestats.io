## Description of Badoo

Imagine walking into the world's largest singles bar, where everyone's looking to mingle, and you've got a pretty good idea of what Badoo is all about. This dating app has been around since 2006, making it one of the grizzled veterans in the online dating world.

### How is Badoo Different From Other Dating Apps?

While apps like [Tinder](/blog/tinder-review) and Bumble focus on the swipe-left, swipe-right mechanic, Badoo takes a more shotgun approach (spray and pray if you're a gamer).

Its standout "People Nearby" feature turns your immediate vicinity into a smorgasbord of potential matches. It's like having x-ray vision to see all the single people around you – for better or worse.

### User Base Overview

With over 500 million registered users worldwide, Badoo's user base is nothing short of staggering.

It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack – except the haystack is the size of Mount Everest, and some of the needles are actually cleverly disguised pieces of hay.

The diversity here is unparalleled. You'll find everyone from college students to divorcees, from those looking for a quick fling to others seeking their soulmate.

It's a melting pot of dating intentions, cultural backgrounds, and relationship goals. Just remember, with great diversity comes great responsibility – to filter effectively.

## Badoo Pros & Cons

### Pros:

- Massive user base that increases your chances of finding a perfect match (it's a numbers game, after all)
- Photo verification feature that helps combat the plague of bogus profiles (though it's not foolproof)
- Location-based matching for easy meetups (perfect for spontaneous dates or travel hookups)
- Surprisingly functional free version (you won't feel like a second-class citizen)
- "Lookalikes" feature lets you find doppelgängers of your celebrity crush (shallow? Maybe. Fun? Absolutely.)
- Video chat option for safer, pre-meetup screening (because nobody wants to be catfished)

### Cons:

- High number of fake profiles and scammers (it's like navigating a minefield sometimes)
- Aggressive push for premium features (prepare for pop-ups galore)
- Can feel overwhelming due to the sheer volume of users (decision fatigue is real, folks)
- Quality control is hit-or-miss (for every gem, there's a mountain of coal to sift through)
- The "anything goes" atmosphere can attract some sketchy characters (keep your wits about you)

## Who Is Badoo For?

### Badoo is for you if:

- You're looking for casual dating or friendship without the pressure of immediate commitment
- You thrive in a high-volume, fast-paced dating environment (think speed dating on steroids)
- You're open to meeting a bunch of people from diverse backgrounds and with varied intentions
- You're comfortable with a more "anything goes" atmosphere and can handle some potential weirdness
- You enjoy the thrill of the hunt and don't mind putting in work to find quality matches
- You're an extrovert who gets energized by constant social interaction

### It's not for you if:

- You're seeking serious, long-term relationships right off the bat (though they can happen, it's not the norm)
- You prefer a more curated, quality-over-quantity approach to dating
- You're easily overwhelmed by too many options or get decision fatigue quickly
- You have a low tolerance for potentially fake profiles or time-wasters
- You're looking for a highly curated experience like [Hinge](/blog/hinge-review) provides
- You're not comfortable with the idea of your profile being visible to a massive number of people

## Key Features of Badoo

### People Nearby

This is Badoo's crown jewel. It shows you potential matches in your immediate vicinity, turning your neighborhood into a smorgasbord of dating possibilities. It's great for spontaneous meetups and can be a goldmine if you're traveling. However, be aware that it can also attract some unsavory characters. Use with caution and always meet in public places.

### Encounters

Badoo's version of the swipe game that we've all come to know and love (or hate). It's addictive and can provide hours of mindless entertainment. However, after a while, it can feel like a never-ending carousel of faces, leading to some serious swiper's fatigue. Take breaks, folks – your thumb (and your sanity) will thank you.

### Video Chat

In a world where catfishing is all too common, this feature is a godsend. You can video call your matches directly through the app, allowing you to verify that your potential date isn't actually a 50-year-old dude living in his mom's basement. It's also great for building rapport before meeting in person. Just remember – pants are always a good idea, even for video calls.

### Photo Verification

Users can verify their photos to prove they're real. It's a solid attempt at tackling fake accounts, but it's not foolproof. Think of it as a first line of defense rather than an impenetrable fortress. Always keep your BS detector on high alert.

### Lookalikes

Ever wanted to date someone who looks like your favorite celebrity? This feature lets you search for users who resemble famous people. It's shallow as hell, but let's be honest – we've all had those celebrity crush fantasies. Just remember, looking like Ryan Gosling doesn't mean they'll have his charm or bank account.

### Crush

This feature allows you to "crush" on up to three Facebook friends per day. If they're on Badoo and crush you back, it's a match. It's like playing matchmaker with your Facebook friends list. Use with caution – it could lead to some awkward conversations at the next family reunion.

## Sign-Up Process & Creating a Profile

1. Download the app or visit the website (pro tip: the app tends to run smoother)
2. Choose to sign up with Facebook, email address, or phone number (Facebook can pre-fill some info, but it also means Badoo will have access to your Facebook data)
3. Add at least three photos (one will need to be verified – no catfishing allowed!)
4. Fill out basic info like age, location, and interests (be honest, but also strategic)
5. Complete a brief bio (optional, but highly recommended – this is your chance to stand out from the crowd)
6. Verify your profile through a selfie pose (optional, but it increases your trustworthiness and visibility)
7. Start browsing and matching (but pace yourself – it's a marathon, not a sprint)
   The whole process takes about 5-10 minutes, depending on how much effort you put into your bio and photo selection. Remember, your profile is your digital first impression – make it count!

## Badoo Costs

Badoo operates on a freemium model, which means you can use the basic features for free, but they'll dangle the premium carrot in front of you pretty aggressively. Here's the breakdown:

### Free Features:

- Create and maintain a profile
- Browse and search for matches
- Send messages to matches
- Use the "People Nearby" feature
- Participate in video chats
- Use the "Encounters" swiping feature

### Badoo Premium (prices may vary by region and promotions):

- 1 week: $8.99
- 1 month: $25.99
- 3 months: $63.99 ($21.33 per month)
- 6 months: $95.99 ($16 per month)
  Premium features include:

- See who liked you
- Undo votes in Encounters

  Is Premium worth it? If you're serious about using Badoo and want to maximize your chances, it can definitely enhance your experience. The ability to see who liked you alone can save you a ton of time. However, don't feel pressured to upgrade right away. The free version is surprisingly functional, and you can get a good feel for the app before deciding to invest.

## How Swipestats Rates Badoo

Overall verdict: 3.5/5 - Badoo is a mixed bag, offering a vast dating pool but with some significant drawbacks. It's like panning for gold – there's potential for striking it rich, but you'll have to sift through a lot of dirt first.

### Attractiveness of the girls: 3/5

The attractiveness level varies widely. You'll find some absolute stunners that make you question why they're even on a dating app. But you'll also encounter a sea of average Joes and Janes. It's truly a microcosm of society – beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and there's someone for everyone here.

### User base: 4.5/5

With over 500 million registered users, Badoo's user base is nothing short of massive. You'll rarely run out of potential matches, especially if you're in or near a major city. However, quantity doesn't always equal quality, and the sheer volume can be overwhelming at times.

### Match rate: 3.5/5

The match rate can be decent if you're active, engaging, and put effort into your profile. However, the sheer volume of users means your messages might often get lost in the noise. It's like trying to have a conversation in a packed nightclub – you'll need to speak up and be persistent to be heard.

### Pricing: 3.5/5

The free version is surprisingly functional, which is a big plus in a world where many dating platforms gate off essential features. Premium features are reasonably priced compared to other dating apps, but the aggressive upselling can be annoying. It's like having a persistent salesman following you around the app.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Badoo

### Is Badoo safe?

Sure, if you're trying not to get stabbed. No promises though.

While Badoo has implemented safety features like photo verification, the onus is still on you to stay vigilant. Don't share personal information too quickly, always meet in public places for the first few dates, and trust your gut. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.

### Can you use Badoo without Facebook?

Yes, you can sign up using your email or phone number. No need to link your Facebook account if you don't want to. This is great for those who prefer to keep their dating life separate from their social media presence.

### How do I delete my Badoo account?

To delete your account, go to Settings > Account > Delete Account. Follow the prompts, and your account will be permanently deleted. Remember, this action is irreversible, so make sure you're certain before pulling the trigger.

### Is Badoo good for serious relationships?

While it's possible to find a serious relationship on Badoo (after all, with 500 million users, anything is possible), it's primarily geared towards casual dating and friendships.

If you're looking for something more serious, you might want to check out our [review of the best dating apps](/blog/best-dating-apps) for alternatives that cater more to long-term relationships.

### How does Badoo compare to other dating apps?

Badoo offers a more global and diverse user base compared to apps like Tinder or Bumble. It's less curated than Hinge, focusing more on the quantity of matches rather than quality.

Think of it as the Walmart of dating apps – you can find almost anything there, but you'll need to do some digging to find the good stuff.

### Can I change my location on Badoo?

Yes, Badoo allows you to change your location, which is great for planning ahead if you're traveling or if you want to explore dating options in different areas. However, use this feature responsibly – nobody likes being catfished by someone pretending to be local.

### Does Badoo have read receipts?

Badoo does not have read receipts in its free version. This feature is available in the premium version, allowing you to see when your messages have been read. It's a double-edged sword – it can provide clarity but also lead to overthinking.

### Can I hide my profile on Badoo?

Yes, Badoo offers an "invisible mode" as part of its premium features. This allows you to browse without your profile being visible to others. It's great for those who want to be more discreet or take a break from active matching without deleting their account.
